<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I_MARTHA"><i>CHAPTER I</i>: MARTHA</h2>
</div>


<p>This book ought by rights to have
borne Ruth’s name on the cover instead
of mine. Of the fifty years I
have lived the first twenty were scattered and
lost. The remaining thirty were gathered
as they came, and threaded on a wire which
formed them into a serviceable chain; that
wire was Ruth. She has now broken off and
formed other ties, therefore the years that
remain will probably be scattered like the
first, for there can be no second Ruth. It
may be, even, that I shall be driven to spend
my declining days in an hotel. Meantime I
have a record of experiences common to
many Marthas.</p>

<p>When I decided on the title it happened
to be Ruth’s day out. I had intended, as a
matter of course, to submit the name to her,
and then, suddenly, a wave of mutiny swept
over me.</p>

<p>“The book at least shall be mine,” I said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
to myself. “Ruth has taken possession of
my house, my tradespeople, my children, and,
what was dearer still, my leisure. What
little freedom I have enjoyed has been procured
by a wearisome amount of guile, but
my pen is still my own and shall remain in
my possession.”</p>

<p>It is true that David would never have
burst into immortal song had it not been for
his persecutors who goaded him to lament
yet his works are published under his name
and not under that of the Bulls of Bashan.
Therefore I call this the Book of Martha
and not of Ruth.</p>

<p>When I married, thirty years ago, I
desired to lead a simpler life than is led by
most people. So many women seem to me
like parasites living on the combined labour
of husband and servants. My friend Elizabeth
Tique, with whom I often stayed, kept
a cook, three maids, and an odd man, and
these wretches somehow contrived to fill
every inch of the small house and garden.
It was almost impossible to go into any room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
without finding some one aggravatingly
dressed in spotted cotton, rustling along with
either a damp cloth or a carpet-sweeper or
a tray laden with food. On one occasion, I
remember, I went to my bedroom to write
letters, having left one of the cotton-backs
clearing away the breakfast, and the other,
she of the damp cloth, in possession of the
drawing-room. By some marvellous sleight
of foot they both contrived to reach my
room before me, and were busily engaged
there when I arrived.</p>

<p>“Don’t go away,” I said pleasantly, and
gathering up my blotting-pad and papers I
returned to the drawing-room to write.
I was in the full swing of inspiration when
the door was burst open by a third skirmisher
in the hated uniform. She made her offence
far worse by pretending that her visit was
only one of wanton light-heartedness.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Miss,” she said, “I can
come back by and by; it was only to do the
grate.”</p>

<p>I swallowed the word that rose to my lips—Elizabeth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
says it doesn’t do for the servants
to know we say these things—and took my
papers to the garden; but my letter was no
longer witty. It was full of short disjointed
sentences and tedious information. In a few
minutes I was startled by a terrific rumbling
on the gravel. The odd man was approaching
to mow the lawn.</p>

<p>“Sorry to disturb you, Miss; I shan’t be
above ’alf an hour,” was the way he put it.
There are many possible variations of the
same crime.</p>

<p>“Elizabeth,” I said as politely as I could
when she came out on her way to the shops,
“have you a wine-cellar?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a beauty. Why?”</p>

<p>“Do you mind telling me—is this the
day for cleaning it out?”</p>

<p>“What nonsense; we don’t clean it out.”</p>

<p>“Then may I sit in it?”</p>

<p>Elizabeth was busy with the fish, but she
told me where the key was, and I went
down with a candle. It was cool and quiet
and cobwebby, and I got on nicely. I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
just getting my second wind and had refilled
my fountain pen when I heard a voice—that
of my enemy with the cloth—outside
the door.</p>

<p>“This is the cellar, Mr. Brown. I think
master wished the port put in the second
bin from the left. I’ll just give it a wipe
out if you’ll excuse me.”</p>

<p>I tried the coach-house, but it happened
to be George’s day for swilling it after he
had finished the grass, and when I found a
place in the greenhouse away from the drip
he came and put manure on the tomatoes.</p>

<p>I was engaged to be married to a man
with the usual professional income, and I
began to see very clearly that if I was to be
happy in a small house the number of people
living in it must be reduced as much as
possible. That night when the servants
were all in bed I took up my letters again
and explained this theory to James. He
agreed with me.</p>

<p>We were married early in January, and
went into our house a week later. I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
engaged two maids, both of whom had been
recommended to me as thoroughly capable,
and likely to bring light into the dark places
of my inexperience. They did indeed; I
saw all its weak points very clearly in the
lurid glare of their bright ideas. But that
was later. On our first day at home I went
down to the kitchen as soon as my husband
had gone out. I picked my way through
the cinders, crumbs, bacon-rind, and unclassified
fluff upon the floor, and stood for a
moment blistering before the range where
a blast-furnace raged behind the bars. The
remains of breakfast, which suggested the
snatched meal of a burglar, prepared in haste
and darkness, were on the table, from which
Clara, the housemaid, rose and made a
slippery exit after the manner of a mouse.</p>

<p>I murmured something polite about being
too soon, to which the cook replied that
they were a bit late on account of the range,
and the curtain rose on a farce which will
run as long as I keep a cook.</p>

<p>The bell at the back door then fell into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
the first of a long and distressing series of
convulsions, and Ruth went to its assistance.</p>

<p>“Pleas’m, the butcher,” she reported.</p>

<p>There are many ways of saying “Pleas’m,
the butcher,” and Ruth’s was most discouraging.
I knew at a glance that she
had not properly masticated her breakfast,
and that the arrival of the butcher was not
unlike that of twins at the end of a numerous
and undesired family. She looked as though
her morning had been made up of a series
of unwelcome events and this were the last
straw.</p>

<p>“Tell him to call again,” I said hastily;
“this is an absurd time to come.” I was
going to retire when a second convulsion
shook the house to its foundations.</p>

<p>“Do you wish fish’m?” said Ruth, just
as if I had sent the fish. I hedged and tried
to shift the blame on her.</p>

<p>“Do we want fish?”</p>

<p>“Just as you wish’m,” she said, standing
still in front of me.</p>

<p>She made no attempt to suggest anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll come,” said I, “and see him myself.”</p>

<p>I found a pert-looking male child writing
his name on the pantry window-sill and
whistling.</p>

<p>“What fish have you got?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Plaiceakecoddensole,” he replied, eyeing
me up and down.</p>

<p>I ordered something—anything to convey
the idea that I spoke with knowledge and
deliberation. The greengrocer behaved like
an uncle, and told me that, whatever else I
went without, a nice cauliflower was a thing
I should never regret buying. I expected
him to add that it would last a lifetime and
clean again as good as new.</p>

<p>During this time Ruth had disappeared
into the back kitchen, whence she brought
what at first I took to be a bucket of castor-oil
and a dead rabbit. With the rabbit
(which turned out to be her favourite dishcloth)
she then deluged the table from the
contents of the bucket, and the kitchen was
filled with a warm smell of wet onions.
When she had “cleaned up” as she called it—which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
meant that after her septic operation
on the table she swept the etceteras on
the floor into a heap and drew the fender
over them—we discussed the question of food.</p>

<p>One of the trials of my life is the necessity
for devising three relays of food immediately
after a good breakfast. It makes me feel as
though I were the owner of a yard full of
turkeys, whom it is my painful duty to
prepare for a daily Christmas. James enjoys
his breakfast and forgets about it, returning
after a hard day’s work to a dinner as unpremeditated
as that which the ravens
brought to Elijah; not so mine, which
brings with it haunting memories of yesterday’s
sorrows. I cannot share his enthusiasm
for a <i>vol-au-vent</i> which I have so often met
before in less happy circumstances; I feel
about it as an undertaker might who should
meet his clients masquerading in a ballroom.
James came home at one o’clock, and we
went indoors at once, as he has only a short
time to spare in the middle of the day. The
table was not laid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“Clara,” I said, “do you know the time?
We must have luncheon at once.”</p>

<p>“I think Ruth’s just sending it up now,
m’m,” she answered. “The meat only came
ten minutes ago.”</p>

<p>James spilled a good deal in his haste, but
what little he was able to eat in eight minutes
he was extremely good tempered about, and
praised warmly. A great many men would
have behaved in a manner that might have
made me live and die a bad housekeeper.
If he had been sulky, or violent, or sarcastic,
or resigned, or dignified, I should have taken
no steps whatever. My mind would have
settled upon a touching picture of the sorrows
of women, and how their life is one long
martyrdom to the habits of men and the
want of habits of domestic servants, and I
should have shrugged my shoulders and
acquired tastes of my own. Then this book
would never have been written. As it was,
my husband’s smiling farewell and his
pathetic symptoms of indigestion bravely
borne gave me pain that vented itself in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
anger against its original cause—Ruth—and
behind her again the butcher. I flew
into the study and poured out my wrath on
a sheet of the best note-paper.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“Mr. Jones,<br>
<br>
“Dear Sir,<br>
</p>

<p>“Mrs. Molyneux is simply furious because
Mr. Jones’s wretched beef did not turn up
till ten minutes to one. If Mr. Jones finds
himself unable to keep a clock, Mrs.
Molyneux will be delighted to deal with a
butcher who can.”</p>
</div>

<p>I licked the envelope and the stamp
viciously and rang the bell. “Post this at
once, please, Clara,” I said, “and when Jones’s
boy calls in the morning for orders, tell him
that a thousand years are not as one day to
me, and that he may take his detestable tray of
entrails to—” I stopped just in time—“back
to the shop,” I added. “Yes’m,” said Clara,
looking surprised and, I thought, frightened.
“Would you like a cup of tea, m’m?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>If one is what these people call “upset”
they always suggest tea. Tea as a remedy for
the butcher’s non-appearance struck me as
absurd.</p>

<p>“No, Clara,” I replied, “what I want is not
tea but punctuality. All the same I will have
a cup.”</p>

<p>Of course it was impossible to say anything
to Ruth that afternoon. It would have
been making too much fuss over what
probably was not her fault.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p><h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II_THE_COOK"><i>CHAPTER II</i>: THE COOK</h2>
</div>


<p>A lady who has kept house with
marked success for fifty years once
said to me: “My dear, there are
only three things of any importance in a
house. First the husband, then the nurse,
then the cook, and after that it doesn’t
matter.”</p>

<p>At the time this collected wisdom slid
through my head almost without recognition.
I thought my husband perfect, and
took it for granted that I knew all about
him. I did not then require a nurse, and in
my limitless ignorance I supposed a cook to
be a person who cooks things, and whom, if
she does not cook things well, one replaces
by another cook who does. How, indeed,
should I know more of the nature and
habits of cooks than the general public
knows of the physiology of the animals
which it sees behind bars at the Zoo? At
home I knew that there was a certain fat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
striped creature in the kitchen, whom my
mother was obliged to propitiate before we
could get scones for breakfast, and to whom
I vaguely believed my father said prayers
night and morning. But meals came up
and went down, in winter and summer,
autumn and spring, and that was all that
I really knew about them.</p>

<p>How should an outsider such as I was
know that the personality of a cook is as
pervasive in a small house as that of a mellow
cheese; that she is as powerful as a dog
in a hen-house, as moody as a gipsy, as
amenable to flattery as an old gentleman,
and as inured to dirt as a pig? So far as I
had thought at all, I had always imagined
that there was a household formula called
“giving orders to the cook.” I had not
been married a year before I knew that this
is a term invented by novelists, and which
has no resemblance at all to the fact it is
intended to describe. It is a recognised
fallacy like the Cambridge May week, which
is not in May, but every one knows what is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
meant. Giving orders to the cook really
means a very elaborate process of mental
suggestion. We learn by painful initiation
what are the things she is capable of cooking,
and we try, so far as is possible, to direct her
choice of what she is willing to cook within
the limits of her capacity. By the same
process of mental suggestion we add to her
repertoire of dishes, and according to the
strength of our will and the receptivity of
her mind, she elects by and by to cook more
or less what we want. It is the art of mental
suggestion, not the art of ordering, that
makes a mistress the real keeper of a cook.</p>

<p>For instance, when I first knew Ruth I
used to make mistakes like this: “You might
make a curry of the mutton, Ruth, and give
us some stewed pears for lunch. We will
have fried fillets of fish to-night, with cutlets
from the end of the neck that you have left,
and a batter pudding with jam sauce.” And
Ruth would reply, “Yes’m.”</p>

<p>When the luncheon came up there would
be haricot and apple tart, and for dinner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
fillets of fish done in a wonderful wine sauce,
cutlets, it is true, and a sweet omelette.</p>

<p>“Ruth,” I said next morning, “you did
not cook what I ordered yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I, m’m?” she replied, with the
candid look of a company promoter accused
of fraud. “I’m sure I don’t know how
that happened. I quite thought you said
I was to do up the mutton.”</p>

<p>“Look at the slate.” I pointed out
where curry was ordained in large letters.</p>

<p>“Why, so it was, m’m; I am sorry. I
remember now, I hadn’t any chutney by me,
and I knew master wouldn’t fancy curry
without a bit o’ chutney so I just made a
nice haricot instead.”</p>

<p>“And what about the fried fish?” I
asked. “And the pudding?”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Ruth, “yes’m, we shall want
a nice frying-pan. The one I have isn’t
near large enough to do a nice bit of fish
and it’s not the right shape. A nice enamel
one the next time you are going into town
if you can be troubled to remember.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>Now in these days if I wanted the meals
I have described I should begin:</p>

<p>“How about the mutton, Ruth? What
are you going to do with that?”</p>

<p>“Well, I think, m’m, a haricot would be
as nice as anything.”</p>

<p>“Quite so. And I suppose we shall be
obliged to have fish for dinner.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m—fried fish I suppose?” (Ruth’s
strong point is frying.)</p>

<p>“Some nice little fillets I think master
likes, m’m.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Ruth, fish, cutlets, and a pudding.
I suppose a batter pudding would take too
many eggs?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, m’m, not at all. I could manage
with two nicely.”</p>

<p>“Very well then; that will do beautifully.
We always like your batter puddings so
much better than those they have at Buckingham
Palace; they are so much lighter, and
that jam sauce you make is a dream. And,
by the way” (this is just as I am leaving the
kitchen), “we must have another curry some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
day; Admiral Tobasco said he had never
met one to touch yours that night.”</p>

<p>“Would you care to have the mutton
curried to-day, m’m, as a change from the
haricot?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Ruth, that would be delightful.
What a good idea.”</p>

<p>But it takes years to learn.</p>

<p>New dishes are acquired in the same
way. This is what the novice does:</p>

<p>“Ruth, I want you to try this beef <i>à la</i>
Soudanese, it is quite simple.”</p>

<p>“Beef what, m’m?”</p>

<p>“Beef <i>à la</i> Soudanese. You see it is done
in this way.”</p>

<p>I read the recipe, while Ruth turns away
in silence and begins sweeping up the
hearth.</p>

<p>“Well, Ruth, what do you think of it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just as you please’m, of course.”</p>

<p>“It is quite easy, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>There is a sudden convulsion amongst the
fire-irons, and Ruth turns round wiping her
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“Of course, it must be as you like, m’m.
It’s your place to give orders, I know, but
I’m afraid I shall never give satisfaction
the way I am. My mother’d tell you—and
indeed I’d sooner she came and spoke to you
herself—that I never had no training in
fancy dishes, and all you asked for was a
good plain cook, which I am, as her ladyship
said herself when I left. Of course, you’d
very likely not know, being a young lady
and having no experience in such things,
that we poor girls have to make our own
way, and to be respectable is as much as we
can hope for, and that I always have been,
and I’d sooner starve than take a place where
I couldn’t do my duty, and I think it would
be better if you were to get some one
more experienced; I haven’t been feeling
at all settled lately, the way things have
been”—and so on.</p>

<p>If by chance your mind’s ribs are made of
steel and your sympathies of spun granite, as
some women’s are, this network of unintelligible
wrath will have no power to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
ensnare you, but the average woman takes
years to unwind herself from the thraldom
of female hysteria—and then she wriggles
out of it by guile.</p>

<p>“Ruth,” I say now, “we had a lovely
dish at the club last night. They made a
great fuss about it, and said only an expert
could cook it, but I believe that your clever
brain could find out what it is made of. It
looked like—” and then I describe it.</p>

<p>Ruth makes a wild conjecture and says it
sounds very like the <i>à la</i> Marengo that master
likes so much.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether it is quite that,”
I say thoughtfully, “but we might look in
one of the cookery books and see whether
there is anything like it to start on.”</p>

<p>Then I turn up the recipe for the dish
and suggest that we should try that, and
see how it turns out; perhaps, I add, that she
need not trouble to make scones that afternoon
and that the cold tart will do for
dinner.</p>

<p>As regards their pervasiveness and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
power, it is a remarkable fact that although
most of the inmates of a house know what
the master wants, and a few know what the
mistress wants, and nobody knows what the
housemaid wants, yet every one knows what
the cook wants. If the cook is satisfied the
whole house works smoothly; if not, an
atmosphere of awe and discomfort pervades
everywhere, meals are partaken of in silence
or in a sort of nervous bravado, no bells are
rung, people fetch their own boots, and are
courteous to one another about the toast
sooner than ask for more. And this omnipotent
creature in the stripes and a collar that
will not fasten before ten in the morning is,
as I have said, moody and capricious to the
last degree. She says it is the range, but it
is not really. Left to myself, as I have been
sometimes, I can spend weeks without having
a word with the range. In fact, his commonplace
obedience to rules has often bored me
sadly, and I have wished that he would, just
for once, heat up on his own initiative and
never mind the flues, or even that he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
get in a temper and smoke when all was well
and the dampers regulated to perfection.</p>

<p>But sometimes he and cook cannot hit it
off. I may go down, for instance, at the
proper time, neither too early nor too late,
and be met by a smell that even a very old
skunk would find trying.</p>

<p>“My dear Ruth,” I say, “is it the milk
again or what?”</p>

<p>“It boiled over,” says Ruth, looking outraged
and insulted, “although I only left it
for a minute. I never saw such heat in my
life.”</p>

<p>“How extremely tiresome,” I say, frowning
at the range. Really he might have
been more tactful on this day when I wanted
a special soufflé for luncheon. “I wonder
whether the man did anything to it the last
time he was here?” I say very loudly and
distinctly; and then becoming innocent and
diffident I suggest, “You don’t think shutting
down that damper a little might help, do
you?”</p>

<p>Ruth pushes in the damper, muttering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
something about “must have hot water for
washing up,” although the water is already
bubbling and roaring in the cylinder—but
there, she is a good girl, and you can’t have
everything. Only, I do wish sometimes
that the range had rather more tact and less
common sense.</p>

<p>Talking of ranges reminds me that there
are days when she says it is impossible to
keep the range clean. Those are the days
when she boils everything at full gallop so
that it slops over with a horrid frittering
noise and the smell gets even into my hair-brushes.
I suppose that there are cooks who
have a sense of smell, but they probably die
very young and leave only those who cook
from memory. One question often puzzles
me. Does a good chef ever go near the
scullery? Can real art survive within fifty
yards of that thing which feels like seaweed
and looks like a tennis net? or that tangle
of greasy grey wire that speeds the departing
and welcomes the coming occupant of a
saucepan? Can nightingales’ tongues be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
prepared at a zinc table where pink and
grey rabbit-skins, potato peelings, white of
egg, and the clammy skeletons of fish are
gathered together in reckless confusion?</p>

<p>See a cook’s cupboard and die! It is
very like Naples. There are fifty small tins
all exactly alike, except that some are sticky,
some greasy, and some black with coal dust;
their lids are bent into fantastic shapes which
prevent them from being opened without a
struggle. There are pepper-pots whose holes
are stopped up with fat and rust; glass jars
containing different sizes of corrugated white
bullets; nameless brown powders at the
bottom of blue paper bags, screwed up at
the neck, and with a currant sticking to the
bottom; copies of last year’s <i>Times</i> stained
with paraffin; a cashmere boot, much worn
at the heel; fire-lighters smeared with glue
and sawdust; a spoon with a piece of cold
bacon in it, and one of your best plates from
upstairs—chipped.</p>

<p>I suppose Ruth thinks that because we are
but dust she had better go on building us up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p><h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III_THE"><i>CHAPTER III</i>: THE
HOUSEMAID</h2>
</div>


<p>The worst thing about housemaids
is their restlessness. Their passion
for traveling about from one room
to another becomes at last a sort of nervous
disease. I have already described my discomfort
in the constant traffic of Elizabeth
Tique’s small house, and the excellent plans
I made to ensure solitude and peace in my
own. But does anyone suppose for a moment
that one single-handed mistress can check
the migratory instincts of a full-grown housemaid,
any more than she could impede the
perpetual silent passage of a tortoise from
the artichoke bed to the hot-house and round
by the rhododendrons?</p>

<p>I worked hard at the problem for some
years. When we are young and hopeful it
is quite easy to imagine that we are altering
the facts of Nature. We talk glibly about
our schemes for reforming drunkards, of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
likelihood of the British working man becoming
interested in art, and so on. In
the same way I saw no difficulty then in the
idea of persuading a housemaid to finish one
room at a time. I spoke very nicely about
it at first. I said:</p>

<p>“Clara, I wish that you would begin one
room at a time and then finish it, instead of
going about doing little bits of things in
each. It makes you so ubiquitous.”</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, m’m?”</p>

<p>“So here, there, and everywhere,” I explained.
“Of course it is very nice to have
you so active, but now, for instance, why
couldn’t you finish my sitting-room or my
bedroom? I don’t mind which, so long as
I could have somewhere to write. You
chased me about this morning as if I were
a hen that wanted to sit at the wrong time.
You know I hate having my legs dusted.”</p>

<p>“I was going to do the windows, m’m, as
soon as you went out.”</p>

<p>“But, Clara, you know quite well that if
I went out I should find you in the first shop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
I went to, polishing the grocer’s nose or
something—”</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, m’m?”</p>

<p>It was useless to explain further. I made
a schedule of work for Clara in which each
portion of her day was mapped out in such
a way that she would be continuously in one
place for at least an hour at a time. I might
as well have made a time-table for the
weather. I have heard that there are
mistresses who make schedules for their
servants and get them followed: but whether
these people achieve their results by hypnotism
or force I do not know. I have been
able now and again to arrest the disease in
Clara for a short time, but I do not believe
that there is any permanent cure for ubiquity
in housemaids.</p>

<p>Another infirmity to which all of them
are subject is morning blindness. When I
go to bed at night my sitting-room is often
far from tidy. I leave, perhaps, a thimble,
scissors, a cherished pen, sheets of manuscript,
some books, and a parcel or two on the table.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
By the time Clara has made her mouse-like
exit next morning my table is as clear as a
baby’s conscience. I hunt about muttering
bad words for some minutes and then ring
the bell. But no, Clara has seen nothing.
She never puts anything away: perhaps
master has had them——</p>

<p>“Yes, Clara,” I reply sarcastically, “I have
no doubt that your master is at this moment
playing ‘hunt the thimble’ in his office and
cutting out paper boats with my scissors and
manuscript. As for my book, probably the
cat has taken it back to the library to be
changed.”</p>

<p>Clara becomes huffy, and says she “hasn’t
an idea, ’m sure.”</p>

<p>“I know you haven’t,” say I, “I don’t
want you to have ideas. I want you to have
eyesight, and a memory, and a little self-control.
Why cannot you leave things
where they are? Or, if you must put something
away, why not those crumbs under the
table or those empty envelopes or the mouldy
paste that I used last week?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>I have heard of kittens being blind for
some days after birth, but it is my own
discovery that housemaids are blind for some
hours after they get up.</p>

<p>I do not know how it is, but I get more
tired of my own face and the housemaid’s
than of anything else on earth. Probably
no criminal feels more imprisoned with his
warder than a woman can feel shut up in
her own house with one or two servants;
and she is so much the worse off that there
is no free future to look forward to. A very
unusual touch of sympathy occurs in a
modern play where the writer makes his
heroine retire to an empty room to have a
bad headache in peace. Before she has had
time to crumble into a comfortable ruin on
the sofa, there is a knock at the door and in
comes a housemaid armed with a tin and
some little fidgety bits of rag to “polish the
taps in Miss Iris’s bathroom.”</p>

<p>The public would surely be touched if
they realised the fact that there is often no
spot in her own house where the daughter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
of woman may lay a tear unobserved. Some
women do not want to cry; they have
nothing to fear from Sarah Ann. But to
those who do, this constant espionage becomes
a positive torture.</p>

<p>There are few things that I envy men so
much as their leisure for getting on with
their work. They have offices, studies,
studios, in which they spend weary hours in
a nerve-racking pursuit of guineas, or the
appropriate word, or an elusive idea, but they
are generally doing one thing at a time.
They are not harassed by incessant irruptions
from other workers bursting with irrelevant
information about their underclothing or the
state of the weather, nor are they pestered
with foolish conundrums about weights and
measures and the kind of subjects that “Old
Moore’s Almanac” deals with so willingly.
It is always possible to slam one’s door and
lock it, but who really feels comfortable
under the stigma of peculiarity? The
comment which follows unusual conduct is
in itself a violation of privacy, and so far from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
being alone, the offender is merely isolated
the better to be observed.</p>

<p>I do not mind ordering things—it isn’t
that; nor do I mind thinking about them—thinking
quite hard. It is “seeing about”
them that turns my blood to vitriol and my
heart to dynamite.</p>

<p>Is a general in command of forces expected
to see that his subalterns put on their clothes
right side out? When he orders a charge
does he find his men seated facing their
horses’ tails? Does the captain of a ship
put out to sea only to be told when he has
crossed the Bar that “the wheel has come
off in the mate’s ’and,” and that there is no
more grease for the engines? And yet I
believe that is the kind of thing that would
happen if a mistress and her servants started
out to discover America.</p>

<p>It is rarely that a servant in a small house
considers herself responsible for anything.
It is thought discreditable to the mistress
alone if the house is dirty and the meals
badly served; and yet she has seldom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
the skill or the leisure to give point to
her criticisms by setting a working example
to those under her orders.</p>

<p>And the poor creature must learn so many
trades. It is not enough that I strain
my brains to bursting-point in order to
think out new forms of nourishment for
James, but I must learn the anatomy and the
personal habits of the creatures he devours,
conduct post-mortem examinations to discover
whether they died too soon or not
soon enough, whether they had eaten too
much or not eaten enough, taken too much
exercise or led too sedentary a life. I must
be perpetually on the look-out to circumvent
the countless ruses which Satan suggests
to half a dozen intelligent tradesmen. I
must know exactly in what combination the
things I have bought will best amalgamate
in James’s inside, and I must then somehow
convey my knowledge through the tough
skull of my cook. When at last I have got
both food and ideas safely lodged in her
keeping I must find the dish on which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
she is to serve it, and, worst of all, besiege
her incessantly with alarm clocks and gongs
to ensure its appearance at the right time.</p>

<p>When the meal is sent up only half of my
work is done. I have to keep an eye on the
tools with which James is to eat it, otherwise
they are liable to be blunt, sticky,
or placed crookedly on the table. After
this James eats his dinner in peace, whilst
I make a mental note of Clara’s personal
habits, her flowers to praise, or her weeds to
blame, and either or both to loathe; her
elaborate elegancies of manner, or the fact
that she always forgets to hand the sauce
before she goes back to stand on one leg
by the sideboard and listen to our conversation.
I have stopped that now and told her
not to wait, which means that she goes
off to the bedrooms between the courses and
does not hear the bell.</p>

<p>I can hear the efficient female say scornfully
that I should get servants who know
their business; but she forgets that if she or
I do not have to train our striped geese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
in the sweat of our brows it means that some
other mother of a family has done it—or
perished in the attempt—and that Sarah Ann
has left to “better herself.” Also one of the
most efficient characteristics of the efficient
female is her powerful fascination for servants
of the clockwork-mouse type whom
I abhor. Their machinery has been made
by people with different tastes from my
own, and when I have found the key and
wound them up they begin folding table-napkins
into wine-glasses with horrid
dexterity, or they play a sort of suburban
Halma called “ladies first” when they hand
the courses.</p>

<p>Clara’s migratory instincts, her ubiquitousness,
and her morning blindness were
a constant annoyance to me, yet I look
lovingly back upon them now over the heads
of a succession of young persons, all of whom
had occupied positions of trust in the houses
of the semi-educated. When Clara left me
in order to marry a traveller in sewing
machines I acquired a wonderful insight into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
the habits of the public dignitaries in
our neighbourhood. I learned that the
Mayoress of Pond never grudged the expense
of paper mats under the fruit and preferred
her sandwiches tied with pink ribbon.
That Lady Knight believed in putting out
Sir Donald’s clothes herself in the evening,
and that it was not customary in the houses
of the commercially great to clean the silver
more than once a week “unless there
was company.”</p>

<p>I once asked one of these Belles Brummells
whether it was better form not to
wash before dinner unless for a party of eight,
and she replied gravely that it was a matter
of taste, and did I wish hot water; she had
no objection to bringing it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—I read this part aloud to the
efficient female and she says that was not
what she meant.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV_TRADESMEN"><i>CHAPTER IV</i>: TRADESMEN</h2>
</div>


<p>The story of Mr. Jones’s sin, and
how he failed to send the meat in
time for luncheon, has been told.
But it must not be supposed that this was
the one sin of a lifetime, standing out clear
and black against a white background of
habitual punctuality. Nor was he a lonely
serpent in an otherwise spotless Eden of
tradesmen who walked with God. They
were all Sons of Belial. If I could turn the
whole lot of them into pillars of salt, and
cheese, and mutton, and cabbage, and all
the other dilatory and perverse ingredients
of my daily life I would do it, and they
might go on “never coming” as much as
they liked. They might stay there all day
making apologies and it would not matter
to me. I should simply come and hack off
the pieces I wanted and not listen to a word
they said.</p>

<p>Of course, in one way, a shop answers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
the same purpose. But there is not the
same pleasure in asking for a thing as there
would be in hewing it off the person of
one’s enemy. And, besides, the shops are
always full of women who want to look at
everything they buy.</p>

<p>Sometimes I have waited quite a long
time while some silly creature with a long
upper lip and a badly balanced hat fiddles
about with two tins of mustard and explains
why neither will do. When it comes to my
turn and the shopman says: “Pepper, m’m;
yes, m’m; I’ll just show it you,” and rushes
off before I can catch him, it makes me so
angry that I forget all the other things I
wanted. I know all that there is to be said
on the other side about the advantages of
shopping oneself. It is not for nothing
that I have encountered the efficient female
on our own ground. But if I have been
flattered she has had exercise, that is one
thing! Some are born housekeepers, some
achieve housekeeping, and some have the
horrid thing thrust upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>They say seeing is believing, but somehow
I find it impossible to believe in a
tradesman even after I have seen him, and
the few things I do believe about him I
don’t like. The ego of the fishmonger, as
well as that of his representative imp who
scribbles his name daily on every available
wall-space near the back door, is to me
wholly uncongenial, and I dislike the
exaggerated value he puts on the creatures
whom he conjures from the deep.</p>

<p>“Nice plaice,” he says, handing me a
thing all face, like a certain type of person
who frequents concerts and goes on deputations
and boards. It has a deep frill of some
scaly substance round its small body, and at
one end the frill becomes a regular flounce.
“Eightpence a pound. I’ll fillet it nicely
for you, m’m.”</p>

<p>By the time he has filleted away the face,
and the frill, and the flounce, and half a
square foot of backbone I am left with four
elusive little rags that no amount of heavy
breadcrumbing on Ruth’s part will make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
into a serviceable dish for a hungry man.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you are right in calling
plaice a nice fish,” I said the first time this
happened. “Haven’t you got anything
with a little more body to it?”</p>

<p>He offered me turbot at two shillings a
pound. There was certainly more of it, but
it looked thoroughly wet through and uncomfortable,
and he told me that the oily
skin was the best part! There are all the
smaller fish of course, but I cannot help
watching James when he has anything with
bones, it makes me as nervous as if I saw
him eating a wet handkerchief full of pins.</p>

<p>And there is nothing like fish for “never
coming.” If my own grandfather were a
fishmonger and I saw him being chased up
the street by a mad bull I should refuse to
believe that he would “be there as soon as I
was.” With butchers, too, I find that we
pay for more than we either ask or desire.
A leg of mutton with a hairy cloven hoof on
the end (I still live in the hope of Mr. Jones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
lacing a neat boot on it some day when he
thinks I am not looking and then saying it is
a mistake he cannot account for) is an insult
both to the living and to the dead. And
there are tongues with a ton of salt in them.
Mr. Jones weighs the tongue as it comes
soaking from the tub and charges me for
the heavy dripping mass of salt. He sends
it to the house by the hands of a little
boy who is fond of marbles, a keen spectator
of football, and popular with his young associates.
By the time Ruth gets the tongue
on to her weighing machine it differs by
several pounds from the little blood-stained
hieroglyphic pinned to it. Mr. Jones explains
this by the theory that it has “shrunk
on the way from the shop.”</p>

<p>If I might bear a few of Mr. Jones’s misdeeds
to the Judgment Seat they should lose
none of their full weight by my loitering
on the errand!</p>

<p>I think Ananias the greengrocer became
prosperous and has such a nice large clean
shop because he is so resourceful. I have never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
asked him any question which he could not
answer satisfactorily, and the matter I speak
of always seems to be one which he has
already gone into very carefully on his own
account. I asked him once why his potatoes
were dark purple and full of holes, and he
said that it was the time of year. But I was
prepared for that and brought in a neat
rejoinder.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, “that is the proper answer,
I know, but how is it that I can get excellent
ones in the shops lower down?”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, m’m, <i>those</i>,” he replied; “of
course we can get you <i>that</i> sort of potato
if you wish it, but I hardly think, if you
knew the sort of places they come from,
you’d fancy them. A very nice, cheap potato
for the price, and has a nice appearance,
but——”</p>

<p>He shook his head with an expression of
such dark mystery that I let the potatoes
alone. In fact, I had a moment’s vague
wonder whether the other kind were grown
in the hospitals or whether white slaves with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
maimed hands dug unceasingly for them in
a distant rubber plantation.</p>

<p>Another day I asked him why his lettuces
were a penny more than anyone else’s and
whether he charged for the caterpillars
sandwiched in them. He said that it was
quite a mistake my having had the one with
the caterpillar. He had noticed it at once
when they were brought in, and had particularly
told the young lady to destroy the lot.
He was very glad I had mentioned it, and
he could give me the best lettuces in the
market for a penny halfpenny if I did not
object to their having no hearts. He always
sent those with hearts unless he was specially
told otherwise by ladies who were obliged
to consider trifles.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V_THE_DINNER"><i>CHAPTER V</i>: THE DINNER
PARTY</h2>
</div>


<p>For some weeks after I began housekeeping
I had a feeling that all was
not right with Ruth. She would not
talk about food when I went to the kitchen,
but somehow or other she always managed
to bring in some remark about the people in
the houses near us.</p>

<p>“Underdone, m’m? Yes, m’m, I quite
understand,” she said one day in answer to
a criticism of mine. “Speaking of which,
m’m, do you happen to be acquainted with
Raws, in Windermere Place?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean Colonel and Mrs. Raw?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, m’m; the young person who lives
with them as cook is sister to my young man,
and I just happened to mention who you
were, m’m, and how I was living with you.
She was very pleased to think I was so well
off, and asked if we were very busy just now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>She made two or three more references
to the great and good on whose cast-off legs
of mutton we lived so happily (they had
the loins and the shoulders, and we had the
necks and legs, and, I regret to say, the tripe).
At last she became more explicit.</p>

<p>“Hardly seems worth while making these
fancy dishes just for you and master, does it,
m’m?” she said despondingly. “It would
be different if you were having company and
we wanted to show what we <i>could</i> do.”</p>

<p>It dawned on me then that Ruth was
craving for morbid excitement. She longed
to be at her wits’ end—that land of the leal
where every true domestic servant loves to
wallow and bemoan her lot. It was not
long before she had her heart’s desire.
People began to call, and when they began
there was no stopping them. They came
in barouches and in motors, on foot and in
four-wheeled flys, from which the chaste kid
boots of the elderly and the Parisian shoes of
the rejuvenated descended in rich profusion.
Clara found it more and more difficult to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
dressed in time; in fact, when Mrs. Ajax
and Mrs. Beehive took me first on their
rounds and arrived at a quarter to three, it
was Ruth, smutty and indignant, who opened
the door.</p>

<p>I spoke severely to Clara afterwards, and
found that it was her migratory instinct which
had betrayed her again. She had been upstairs
to get dressed, and had wandered off to
the washhouse in the middle of her toilet to
fetch a clean apron.</p>

<p>“Which reminds me, Clara,” I said. “Why
does it take you so long to get tea when
people call? You were three-quarters of an
hour yesterday after I rang.”</p>

<p>“The kettle wouldn’t boil, m’m,” Clara
replied.</p>

<p>She gave me the impression of having at
last lost patience with her former accomplice,
the kettle, and decided to “tell on him.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” I said, “you don’t think we had
better have a man in to see about it, do you?”</p>

<p>Clara wavered for a moment between
professional scorn of this suggestion and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
irresistible bait I had thrown out. She
hesitated and compromised.</p>

<p>“Well, m’m, it <i>ought</i> to boil quicker; but
perhaps next time Mr. Whistle is in the
house we might get him to have a look at
it; it may be too heavy a make.”</p>

<p>I regard this as Clara’s masterpiece.</p>

<p>But Ruth’s prayers were answered. The
“neighbourhood” called, we dined out, and
by and by we had to feed others in return.</p>

<p>James and I decided against the professional
cook and “hired help,” so it remained to
break the news to Ruth and Clara. I told
them separately, on a bright morning in June
when the little juicy lambs were hanging in
clusters in the shops, and expectant peas
burst through their pods in every market
garden of our hospitable suburb. Ruth bore
up wonderfully; in fact, after the first sob of
terrified ecstasy I had very little trouble with
her. But Clara cried a good deal, and was
afraid that her waiting would not do justice
either to herself or to me.</p>

<p>However, I told her how Napoleon had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
risen from quite a little chap to what he
afterwards became, entirely by his own
efforts; and I also reminded her of a famous
judge in my own family who had once been
an office boy. And then we all three began
to “see about” one thing and another. I
felt like an ophthalmic fly by the time we
had done, with all its numerous eyes in a
state of acute inflammation. I saw the stock
for the soup. I saw the fish, and the paper
it came in (which means a lot), I saw the
sweetbreads, and wondered how James can
be so fond of them. I saw the potatoes and
the peas; that was nothing, really—half an
eye did it, and the other half-eye caught the
salad, just to be sure it was fresh. The
tournedos of beef took an immense lot of
seeing, and when they came up James saw
them all over again, and they were not good.
The efficient female has since explained to
me why theirs are always perfect, but in my
soul I believe that there is hanky-panky, if
not plain swank about her fillets. Anyhow,
some evil planet always shines on mine, so I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
have made up my mind now that Providence
does not wish me to have fillets, and that He
knows best, so we have saddle of mutton
instead.</p>

<p>There was more brain-work and less inspection
required for the pudding. When
Ruth asked me if I would like to see the
eggs, I said no, that was a question for
the hen’s conscience, and one must leave
something to somebody. Neither would I
waste precious eyesight on the butter. I
knew it was a lot, and the less seen about it
the better. If I could have seen an ice-machine
amongst our kitchen properties I
should have felt less irritable. I know that
the efficient female makes hers in something
very simple—a biscuit tin or a boot, I forget
which—but we were all too amateurish for
these conjuring tricks. We have to get our
rabbits out of shops like other people, and I
would not trust an omelette made in James’s
hat. We bought a machine at great expense,
and when at last, wet to the knee and chilled
to the bone, I hurried upstairs to dress, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
saw with my last eye a vision of two alternatives—one,
successive platefuls of congealed
cream; the other, a petrified mass, bounding
at the first touch of the spoon from end to
end of our parquet floor. Which would
it be?</p>

<p>I once read in the “Book of the Home”
that the cook should lie down for a couple
of hours before beginning the serious work
of a dinner party. According to the author
of the book all preparations should be made
the day before; then, when the <i>generalissima</i>
is roused from her bed at 5 p.m., there is
practically nothing to do except to put the
heavy guns in the oven and pass a salamander
over the light infantry. The key to the
situation, the brainy part, the staff office,
whatever you like to call it, lies in the sauce-boats,
and the gods alone decide what goes
on there.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, everything turned out
quite differently. Ruth prepared nothing
the day before; she rose late on the morning
of the engagement, and omitted to clean the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
flues. We had a terrific fire going all day,
and she ran about the kitchen at top speed,
purple in the face, trembling and uncomplimentary.
Far from the two hours of
peaceful sleep anticipated by the “Book of
the Home,” she had not even time to
wash up after luncheon, and, as it was,
dinner was more than ten minutes late. It
is sad, but remarkable, that nothing ever
happens to me in the way that books and
efficient people claim as a certainty; but I
am sure that Ruth enjoyed the dinner more
than Mrs. Beeton ever enjoyed anything.
You lose half the fun of a dish if you know
beforehand what it is going to look like.
The range, with his unfailing common sense
and utter lack of artistic feeling, behaved
strictly in accordance with his flues, slightly
undercooking some things and burning
others just a trifle: but the ice was perfect.
I have often made ices in the same way, and
they have turned out failures, which just
proves what I have always said, that cookery
books are written in the same spirit as “The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
Home Conjurer,” “Every Man His Own
Chauffeur,” “How to Become a Golf
Champion by Post,” and so on. The people
who write them do not want us to know
how they do the things, so they keep us
harmlessly employed with a few simple rules
while they themselves go on cooking and
conjuring and get paid for it.</p>

<p>Ruth, Clara, the charwoman, and a
borrowed housemaid sat up until twelve
washing dishes, breaking a few, and filling
the air with hilarity born of tea, fatigue,
and insufficient food. But Ruth was happy.
We had had company and she had been at
her wits’ end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI_THE_JOB"><i>CHAPTER VI</i>: THE JOB
GARDENER</h2>
</div>


<p>After all I had suffered at the hands
of Elizabeth Tique’s gardener I
determined not to keep one at all.
That is the kind of resolution one makes,
judging a whole class from a single specimen,
and then buying experience. But it seemed
to me that just as a cook is too pervasive in
a small house, so a gardener occupies too
much space in a small garden. I remembered
the mowing machine, and the manure, and
one thing and another, and thought how
much enjoyment I should get from doing
the garden myself, with the help of an
occasional man. I did not know that in our
neighbourhood that particular breed of garden
pest is called a Saturday scratcher. If I had
heard the term sooner I might have guessed
what he would be like, but I engaged one in
my innocence, and bought experience like
other people. I engaged him on the recommendation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
of an enemy, and he tramped
over the flower-beds to my door early one
morning. He was just the sort of working
man who gets caricatured on the music-hall
stage: infinitely ugly and full of inane conversation.
His opening remark annoyed me.</p>

<p>“Pretty little bit o’ garden you’ve got ’ere
mum.”</p>

<p>“That’s a liar,” I thought, considering the
weeds and the seedy laurel bushes, but I
resolved not to give way to prejudice.</p>

<p>“There is a good deal to be done, Mr.
Mullins,” I said vaguely. The fact was, I
knew what I wanted the garden to look like
when it was done, but my ideas began and
ended there. I was as ignorant as Mullins
himself; the difference between us was that
I was not nearly so stupid. That is why we
could not get on; if his wits had been equal
to mine we should have devised something
between us in spite of our ignorance—I was
going to say, with the help of our ignorance—because
we should have done something
entirely original. Being unhampered by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
foregone conclusions born of knowledge, we
should not have had our inspirations blighted,
as so many people have who understand the
possibilities of an art. And we might have
revolutionised the laws of Nature; one never
knows! But Mullins was a fool; he did not
understand when I said that I wanted the
garden to look as if the things grew there by
themselves.</p>

<p>“You’ll want some nice beddin’-out
plants, mum, if that’s so,” he observed.</p>

<p>“But, Mullins,” I said feverishly, “surely—do
pull yourself together—isn’t bedding
out that horrid thing you do with a plumb-line?”</p>

<p>“No, mum, no,” he replied, “pardon me,
I don’t think you quite understand. Beddin’
out is nice young ’ardy plants that comes to
their prime durin’ the summer months; gives
far more effect they do than anything else.”</p>

<p>I remained doubtful, but weakened; he
smiled in such a kindly, authoritative way.</p>

<p>“I used to be gardener with your ’usband’s
pa, mum,” he ventured, just at the critical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
moment. “What a nice gentleman ’e was!
and what a fine garden they always ’ad! We
used to commence beddin’ out just about
now, mum.”</p>

<p>I fell headlong into the gin. Mullins
was utterly stupid and never took a point,
but he made them sometimes and scored.</p>

<p>“He must know,” I thought, “why
James’s father had acres and acres of hot-houses!”
Then I remembered something;
I clutched at a memory of my mother walking
round the gardens at home. “The
herbaceous border is getting rather thin,
Ptarmigan,” I seemed to hear her say; “there
won’t be enough flowers for the house. I
can’t bear your stiff hot-house things.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, Mullins,” I said, upon this dim
vision, “but I must have a good herbaceous
border, or else we shall not have enough
flowers for the house.”</p>

<p>“Make you a nice ’erbaceous border along
that ’ere wall, mum,” he replied obligingly.</p>

<p>So we set to work. I bought catalogues
and books of instructions; I also took in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
<i>Amateur Gardener</i>. But this is the kind
of way one gets let in. The book says:</p>

<p>“Pyrox gypsomanica (poor man’s rose).
A very free flowering perennial; deep bright
purple, standard growth; May to October;
suits any soil.”</p>

<p>“Mopincosa juicyflorum. (English hibiscus);
orange, scarlet, and blue; very prolific;
suitable for damp waste places where soil
occurs rarely; flowers all the year round.”</p>

<p>All this is just the cookery-book trick
in another form. The people who write
these books evidently form a ring, like oil
magnates and deceivers of that sort; they
monopolise the cooking and gardening that
is done, and then they send out misleading
literature telling us how simple it all is and
getting us to buy their wares. I bought
what the seedsmen’s lists called “strong
hardy plants” of all sorts of beautiful things
that were guaranteed to flower freely in
damp waste places. Mullins and I planted
them, and that was the last we heard of
them. The places we chose were quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
damp enough; I am sure about that. Of
course Mullins made it a point of honour
to disapprove of everything I planted—one
must expect that of any gardener—but in
fact his were not any more successful than
mine, and they cost more to buy. My
private opinion is that on the night after I
sowed any seeds Mullins came out with
a small lantern, collected the soil, sifted
it, and made Quaker oats for his breakfast
next morning out of my godetia and poppy.
I have read that mandragora or poppy is
a powerful drug, and I suspect that is partly
what is the matter with Mullins.</p>

<p>We put in bulbs, too, which no doubt he
stuffs with some savoury compound and finds
an excellent substitute for onions, and more
digestible; either that, or else the entire
gardening trade is riddled with the direct
descendants of Ananias, and that seems almost
too sweeping a statement to be credible.
I prefer the Mullins’ meals hypothesis.</p>

<p>At present I have quite a bright little
garden, and this is the plan on which I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
have achieved it. I have a border of stuffed
cats down one side; they are of various
sizes, and their glass eyes make a bright spot
of colour amongst the misty duns and greys
of their outer coatings; they are perennial,
and not easily dashed by rain. Down
the other side I have spread a wide border
of coarse red flannel, and on this I contrive to
raise quite a number of little evergreens. In
the round beds (where the efficient female
tells me there is nothing to prevent my
having a capital show of roses) I have
planted a nice lot of aspidistras. James has
a friend who owned an aspidistra which
he sent to a cold-storage place with a
van-load of furniture when he went abroad
for five years. The aspidistra was not
valuable, and he did not much care if he
never saw it again. But it was all right when
he came back, and had put out a number of
green shoots.</p>

<p>My third contrivance in the greenhouse
where I have some plants is to put up wire
netting to keep off Mullins. He used to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
in there two or three times a day “just to
give a look round,” as he called it, and after
his visits it was impossible to keep anything
alive except large families of green fly, which
he seemed to bring with him. I had quite
a promising collection there one week—some
geraniums, a fuchsia or two, a hardy palm, and
the remains of a good rose: it was nothing
like dead when I left it that morning at
ten o’clock. At twelve Mullins humped up
the iron stair which leads to the greenhouse,
spat once on the floor, exclaimed
“Hum! ha! ho!” in a loud voice, and sent
a message by Clara asking me for four-and-sixpence.
By the afternoon there was not
a living plant in the place, and the air was
thick with green fly.</p>

<p>I once counted the number of pests
(exclusive of Mullins) which I collected
from the greenhouse and garden. I used to
scrape balls of animated grey fluff off the
staging and bottle different specimens of
the attenuated orange and black works of the
Almighty which I caught skating in and out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
of the soil, either on their stomachs, or with
a pianola-like flexibility of touch on an unnecessary
number of legs. I sent all these
specimens to a friend at the University, and
some of them turned out to be very rare
and quite unusually destructive. There were
forms of fungus, too, in the greenhouse that
were quite pretty but very infectious, and
were really animals—at least I think that was
what he said—and I am absolutely certain
that they were all brought by Mullins.
He still comes, and I still pay him four-and-sixpence
a week, because he keeps out other
Mullinses. And I have learned now, as I
said, to stop him from doing any active
harm; I let him trundle the mowing machine
when I am out, and talk to the cook, and at
Christmas-time he dirties the house with
large bunches of sooty holly, but it all makes
for what the servants call “nice feeling.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII_THE"><i>CHAPTER VII</i>: THE
DOCTOR</h2>
</div>


<p>James had often said that we must get
to know of a good doctor whom we
could call in if either of us was ill;
but neither of us was ill, and we put off our
inquiries until it was too late. Mrs. Beehive
called one day, boasting that she had just
recovered from influenza and really had no
business to be out. Within forty-eight hours
I wished she had never been born, and James
brought a captive gentleman in spectacles to
my bedside.</p>

<p>He held counsel with my inner works
through the usual formulæ and then rang for
hot water. While Clara was bringing it he
adjusted his spectacles, put his hands in his
pockets, and walked over to the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>“Fond of Alpine climbing?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” I gasped, coughing.</p>

<p>“Ah, it’s a grand sport!” he said. “Does
your husband climb?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>“What a wonderful woman his aunt, Miss
Molyneux, is! I remember meeting her at
a whist-drive ten years ago, and she must be
now—let me see—what is her age?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” I whispered, weary after
his pommelling and longing for sleep.</p>

<p>“Pardon?”</p>

<p>I felt myself growing hot. “Ninety-eight,”
I said hoarsely, at a venture. I did not know
how old James’s aunt was, nor whether she
climbed.</p>

<p>“Ah, is she so much?” he reflected, swaying
on his toes. “That’s a nice little fellow”
(pointing to a photograph on the mantelpiece).
“Puts me in mind of Prince Olaf. It
has a great look of him; don’t you think so?
What?”</p>

<p>I nodded and shook my head at the same
time, and kicked the bedclothes. My
temperature was rising rapidly.</p>

<p>“Ah, thank you,” he said, as Clara came
in with the hot water, and then he began
washing his hands. I never knew a man use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
so much soap; it was my special kind at two-and-sixpence
a tablet, and he left it in the
water while he lathered and messed and went
on with the Alpine business. He told me
the names of all the mountains he had been
up, and the routes by which he had unfortunately
come down. He described how
splendidly fit one felt tearing down the snow
slopes on a toboggan (“I wish you would
slide downstairs on what is left of my soap,
and have done with it,” I thought). He
said that he used to have a touch of bronchitis
himself every winter, but it completely left
him after a week at Mürren. After we had
been all round Switzerland with the soap
we came back to one of my favourite towels,
which he reduced to something like a bread
poultice during a ten minutes’ inquiry as to
how many Wagner operas I had heard in
my life, and whether my grandmother was
the wife of a famous fisherman.</p>

<p>I lay panting and exhausted on the bed,
feeling as one does after a long afternoon
spent with a garrulous and deaf old lady.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
Finally the wretch came back to me, fiddled
with the books at my side, criticised them
all, gave me a list of those he had read during
the past forty years, and then got as far as
the door.</p>

<p>“Now keep quiet,” he remarked, looking
down his nose at me with a judicial air,
“don’t have people in here chattering.”</p>

<p>Ill as I was, I could not take this lying
down. I sat up and croaked, “What about
you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll come round to-morrow morning,”
he replied, unscathed by my sarcasm.</p>

<p>When James came home I said I was a
little better and would get up. “What did
you think of Smithson?” he asked. “I am
told he is a clever chap.”</p>

<p>“He’s a first-rate musician,” I said.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“And Alpine climber.”</p>

<p>“How the deuce do you know?” asked
James.</p>

<p>“He has been up the Markhorn, the
Rotterham, the Bungleberg, the Sloshwald,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
all over Borenpest range; then in Wales, the
Greater and smaller Bosh, the Gwaddear,
the——”</p>

<p>James felt my pulse and passed his hand
over my forehead.</p>

<p>“I wonder if I had better ask him to
come round this evening?” he suggested.</p>

<p>“No,” I said, “don’t do that; in fact I
was going to ask you to ring up and say I
am so much better, that I think he had better
not call to-morrow. He is fearfully busy,
and if I am as well as this I want to go into
town and get some soap—and a hatchet——”</p>

<p>James thought me extremely silly, and
said the man was a deuced clever chap. I
bided my time and had my reward later.</p>

<p>James got a bad chill, and I sent at once
for Dr. Smithson. I provided him with a
bag of the ordinary Castile soap, four thick
towels, and my clinical thermometer, and
left the room.</p>

<p>From the study downstairs I could hear
the gentle monotonous flow of sound, and
the hands of the clock moved peacefully on.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
Presently the stream of sound became fuller
as it was joined by another and more familiar
current. There was a prolonged duet. I
thought of the Zonophone Opera Company
in the last part of “Home to our Mountains”;
the clock struck another hour, and I heard
the door open. The first single stream of
sound flowed down the stairs alone, and died
away as the front door banged. I left James
five minutes to get his breath, and then I
went up.</p>

<p>“Well, dear,” I said, “I hope he is going
to do you good. I suppose he does not want
you to have many visitors, no talking——”</p>

<p>“The man’s a damn fool!” said James.
“I couldn’t get a word in edgewise.”</p>

<p>“Did he take your temperature?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied James. “I wanted to put
the thing under my arm—it’s the proper
way to take a temperature—but he stuck it
in my mouth and left it there an hour while
he talked.”</p>

<p>“Did he? Then how did you manage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
to tell him what the treatment ought to
be?”</p>

<p>“I told him what he didn’t seem to know—that
in cases of inflammation what you want
to do is——”</p>

<p>“To set up counter-irritation. I know.
And so you each talked one against——”</p>

<p>“I want some soup,” interrupted James.</p>

<p>“Did you say soup or soap?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Soup, and as hot as possible.”</p>

<p>“Did he say you were to have hot
things?”</p>

<p>“No; but it is obviously the thing
to do.”</p>

<p>I turned, just as I was leaving the room, to
say: “By the way, that’s a nice little water-colour
sketch; do you——”</p>

<p>A leather slipper whizzed past my head
and struck the door.</p>

<p>We have been in many parts of the world
since then, and I have come across a great
number of doctors. Many of them are
amongst the dearest creatures on earth, but,
like all our other loved ones, they have their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
little ways. Clara was ill once, and Dr.
Smithson’s partner came. He explained
everything to me with the greatest care.</p>

<p>“What I should get, Mrs. Molyneux, if
I were you,” he said with great emphasis,
“is a piece of bread. Get your cook to
give you some nice bread, not new you
know, stale—stale bread a couple of days
old—and steep it in a little milk. Heat the
milk (you have a saucepan I expect? that’s
capital!)—get a nice saucepan, then, and I
should wash it first—get it washed for you—your
maid can do that—get it well washed
with soap and hot water, that’s right, wash
it, and then pour the milk in. You have
the milk, say, in a jug—a china jug—quite
so—no doubt it stands in the larder, precisely—well,
you get your cook to give you that
jug of milk, and pour a little into the saucepan
and heat it; I shouldn’t boil it—no,
I shouldn’t indeed. I should heat it and
pour it very gently on the bread. Cut the
bread, you know—get a knife and cut it;
don’t crumb it—that would be too small—cut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
it into nice pieces and pour the milk over
it—you’ll find the girl will do capitally
on it.”</p>

<p>We all hear from doctors about the tendency
of women to be faddy about their health.
The truth of the matter is that every one
likes to feel that something about them is of
importance to some one, and not only to
some one in their own family, but to the outside
world. I used to feel that James was
an interesting personality to many people;
he expounded his views to them, his remarks
were received with sympathy, and he got a
great deal of patting on the back. I didn’t.
Clara and Ruth thought me an eccentric,
amiable creature of another breed from
themselves, a sort of finish to the house in a
way, an ultimate cat on whom to lay responsibility
for failure and domestic sin; but they
were not interested in me. My women
friends were more interested in my habits
than in my personal psychology; James was
mainly interested in my interest in him. It
was sometimes a sore temptation to have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
disease, something that would make at least
three men shake their heads and wonder
what I was doing. They would find out
then what an exceptional character I had—what
courage, what wit under trying circumstances,
what intelligence in household
management (the vacant chair, the cold
bacon, that would bring it all home to them).
James would hurry home in the evening and
read letters to me from people who were all
interested; he would chat—not quite so long
as I wanted, so that I could have the pleasant
qualm of missing him—then he would be
dispatched downstairs to horrid discomfort
where his darling was not, and I should not
have to change into a cold evening dress.
At last I should fall asleep, comfortable,
warm, and washed, knowing that I need not
get up next morning and slave and worry in
unrecognised monotony. Can anyone wonder
that we do it?</p>

<p>But anyone will do as well as a doctor;
a clergyman or a lover if they will take
an interest in one’s soul. I believe that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
a chiropodist who was really concerned
for one’s toes would fill a long-felt want. It
is a curious fact that no one goes to
a lawyer for sympathy, and yet why we
suppose that abnormalities in our liver
will make us interesting in the eyes of a
doctor to whom livers are no treat, while
we neglect our lawyers who will investigate
disorders in our conduct for the moderate
sum of six-and-eightpence, must remain a
mystery.</p>

<p>Suppose that one of us went to a solicitor’s
office and said: “Do you know, such a
queer thing has happened to me! I went
and burgled a poor old gentleman the other
day—stole his watch and a lot of valuable
plate—and outside I met a policeman, whom I
drugged with chloroform on a handkerchief.”
One imagines the solicitor gravely investigating
the matter, finding no old gentleman,
no watch, no stolen plate, and no policeman.
He charges the usual fee, puts a pair of
handcuffs on the lady, and tells her to come
back in a fortnight and have them altered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>A doctor whom I love very much once
made this startling remark to me: “You lead
a very nice life for a lady.”</p>

<p>The words brought to my mind such
pictures as I have never forgotten. Such
vistas of flat, dull landscape stretched before
me; such dead seas of sensible conversation;
such mountains made of interminable
molehills; such continents of golf links and
tennis lawns. All the shores were strewn
with correctly balanced account books and
the <i>débris</i> of tea parties; the trees were
hung with carefully selected and well-boiled
legs of mutton; first-rate parlourmaids
with slight moustaches who understood the
telephone peeped from behind every bush,
and family butchers mated on St. Valentine’s
Day in the place of nightingales. The sky
was made of chill-proof Jaeger, and the
stars were all turned so that their light
fell from behind and on the left side of
the book. My thoughts took the form
of a parody on Lear’s poem about the
Jumblies:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Far from new, far from new, is the land where the ladies live;</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Their tongues are long, and their thoughts are few, and their morals are like a sieve.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The last line will not bear analysis, but I
think that the word “ladies” as he used
it gave me an impression of something that
lets the juice of life escape and retains only
a few husks and skins. A very nice life for
a lady seemed to me little more than a very
nice tissue of habits, but then, no words
mean quite the same thing to any two
people.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII_CHILDREN"><i>CHAPTER VIII</i>: CHILDREN</h2>
</div>


<p>To anyone who has read the foregoing
pages it will be evident that in
starting housekeeping I was obsessed
by two main ideas: one, that I was
not to be a parasite; two, that I was to have
the house to myself during certain portions
of the day. Towards the end of my second
year of marriage I began to pat myself on
the back. But alas! It is this harmless
exercise that seems to be more irritating to
the gods than a thousand crimes.</p>

<p>Congratulate yourself upon anything, from
the affection of a millionaire uncle down to
a recent immunity from colds, and you are
lost. I had won a position of—I won’t say
mistress, but comparative director of my
cook; the fish came at my call. Clara never
finished one room at a time, though we had
established as one rule of the game that, if I
got to my sitting-room first, she could not
begin dusting until she found all the things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
I had lost during the past twenty-four hours.
While she did this I sat in another room
and got on with my work, which had such
an exasperating effect upon her nerves that
after a time she forbore to follow me, however
slowly and aggressively I walked upstairs.</p>

<p>As regards Mullins, the job gardener, I
had got him into the habit of keeping entirely
off the beds. He remained almost
exclusively in the kitchen, where he did very
little harm except to Ruth’s window-boxes,
but she always said it was not much trouble
to plant them again. She also said he was
very useful in giving a hand with the knives,
and in cleaning up. Asking Mullins to
clean up anything seemed to me like inviting
a baboon to tidy one’s wardrobe. In fact,
the efficient female has scarcely spoken to
me since she heard I allowed it. But then
her life is a perpetual warfare. Leisure,
self-indulgence, expense, moral latitude,
wilfulness, tact, all these bright spirits, which
are the making of any reasonable person’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
day, fly before her as butterflies before a bird
with a hungry family; it is a pretty sight.</p>

<p>But to return to my boast. I reviewed
these achievements with my mind’s eye. I
was proud, and there was an end of it.
Within a few months I no longer knew the
meaning of leisure, and I had become a
parasite, living on the habits of my son Tom
and his nurse. All the other people in the
house preserved their independence. When
it became a question who should make the
barley-water, it was my time, not Ruth’s
nor Clara’s nor the nurse’s, that was wasted.
Ruth, without taking her eyes off the range,
said it would be better for anything of the
sort to be made in the nursery for fear
there should be any mistake. Nurse, without
interrupting her work, wanted to know
who was to watch the pan while she was
folding the things in the night-nursery. It
cost me a valuable summer’s morning to find
a place in the domestic machinery where
that pan might sit and boil without disorganising
the day’s work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>Suppose a railway company, having completed
all their arrangements and got everything
into working order, were to be suddenly
informed that the Government had decided
to run a picture palace in the middle of their
head office! I thought of this, and decided
that the difficulties of such a situation would
be a mere <i>Tit-Bits</i> problem compared to my
task of fitting in a nursery amongst Ruth,
Clara, and Mullins.</p>

<p>I awoke regularly at three in the morning,
to find my brain already up and about, sorting
and rejecting answers to such questions
as these: “Who is to wash the kitchen
tea-things while Clara is amusing the baby
when some one calls on nurse’s day out?” or
“What about methylated spirits for boiling
in the nursery? One cannot be always
running to and fro from the kitchen.”</p>

<p>All day long I was pursued by this ceaseless
boiling. “What about boiling the
milk?” “The milk has boiled over.”
“How shall we manage about boiling the
clothes?” “I couldn’t get the water to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
boil.” “You couldn’t boil vegetables in that
pan.” “It has to be brought to the boil
before you can do anything.” “Boiled beef
would come less in the long run.” When
Ruth made this statement I suggested that
beef could hardly come less than Jones’s
mutton did, as that always made a point of
never coming at all whenever it could, and
if there was going to be a longer run than
usual before we got it we had better order
something else at once. She replied that in
that case a nice piece of boiled fish would be
as nice as anything, at which, being a little
over-wrought, I wept, and Ruth was extremely
kind, and said she would just pop the
kettle on to boil. And all this time Tom
lay like a log and did nothing. I was
dependent upon him for everything. My
engagements and my peace of mind hung
upon how he felt, and what his Dr. Boswell
of a nurse alleged that he thought. The
first thing he did was to put an end to my
letter-writing, the second was to break up
my quiet evenings with games, his third<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
enterprise, his masterpiece of iniquity, was
to affiance Ruth to Mullins. At first I had
been dense enough not to trace his hand in
this calamity, but by and by it dawned upon
me, and I questioned Ruth.</p>

<p>“Yes, m’m,” she replied, “things is not
the same where there is children. You don’t
seem to have the place to yourself in the same
way as where there is only a lady.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Ruth,” I interrupted,
“I didn’t quite catch what you said just then.
Did you mean that master Tom takes too
much upon himself? I don’t leave much to
him, really.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, m’m,” said Ruth, “not at all. It
wasn’t that. But where there is children
there is so much that has <i>got</i> to be done.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said thoughtfully, “I see your
point. The same thing has occurred to me.
He gives orders, doesn’t he? Is rather
emphatic—is that what you meant?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, m’m,” she replied, “of course
you would give the orders just the same in
the nursery as elsewhere. It’s your place,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
and I like to have you do it. I’m sure I
should be the last to wish to direct. Indeed,
I shouldn’t care to take any responsibility.
But where there is children you can’t pick
and choose what is to be done in the same
way as where there is only a lady, can you,
m’m? They have to be considered, don’t
they?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Ruth,” I said, “I quite see your
idea, and I think you are right to marry, you
will feel much freer.”</p>

<p>But I had not the least intention that she
should marry yet. Before the month was
up she had decided that Mullins could hardly
give her, as yet, the comforts to which she
was accustomed, therefore the marriage was
postponed. Still, I was conscious henceforth
of the sword over my head, and it was all
Tom’s fault.</p>

<p>He had already annoyed us all by not
being born on the day originally fixed. He
seemed preoccupied and in a hurry when
he arrived, and of course the house was all
upset. He made the best of things, waiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
patiently on the sofa as if we had made the
muddle, whereas, in fact, he was entirely to
blame. Anne, two years later, behaved
quite differently. She entered the date in
her pocket-book, stopped glory-trailing when
the clock struck, and came down buttoning
on a pink skin several sizes too large.</p>

<p>I was sorry for Tom from the bottom of
my heart. He had some natural dignity,
which he needed in the presence of the
women who preyed upon his person and
searched mercilessly for his soul. They
commented upon his personal appearance,
his habits, and his human weaknesses, until I
blushed for them and for him. They made
him look absurd in the street, dressed in a
shawl pinned tightly round him in the shape
of a Virginia Ham, and a drunken-looking
bonnet that lay cocked over one eye, leaving
a draughty space at the back of the neck.
When he laughed they either attributed it
to a defective digestion, or put feeble jokes
in his mouth.</p>

<p>“I’m a bad boy,” he says, Nurse Boswell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
interpreted, “and I’m going to kick my little
heels, I am, and splash the soapy water in
their faces!”</p>

<p>When he broke down and wept from sheer
despair of ever making them understand,
they took him to the blinding glare of a
sunny window and threw him about until he
was obliged to feign indisposition in order
to make them put him down. He came to
me about it sometimes, and I said: “All
right, just lie down quietly, and I will say
you are resting if they come.”</p>

<p>Just as he was comfortably settled a
cheerful voice and clapping of hands was
heard at the door, and in came nurse.</p>

<p>“Well, I never,” she exclaimed, “the
idea! Who took him up? Now then,
master, you just come with me and get
dressed, and we’ll go off and get a mouthful
of fresh air,” and out would come the
rickety bonnet with the draught, and the
Virginia Ham shawl, and off they went to
harden themselves in a biting east wind.
Tom told me afterwards that they met half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
a dozen women, all of whom went into the
grossest personal details about his anatomy,
his weight, and what he ate. The men
tactfully avoided him, for which he thanked
them. Those who had sons of their own
knew about the bonnet and were sorry,
whilst those who had not just saw him as a
sort of egg, and put off his acquaintance
until he should be in a fit state to be
recognised.</p>

<p>Anne was quite different even as a baby.
She humped her back and made faces at the
ladies. Soon she and I combined to protect
Tom in his encounters with the female sex.
We exposed their folly and duplicity in a
shameless way for fear lest they should take
possession of his heart with their forged
certificates of high-mindedness. That our
claims to integrity were no better was not
to the point. We, at least, loved him and
should only mislead him for his good.</p>

<p>Tom, like the rest of his sex, was disposed
to respect the authority against which he
battled so long as he believed in it. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
often said, “Yes, nurse,” quite respectfully,
until Anne came. She soon settled that.</p>

<p>“You go and ask nurse if she loves you,”
she said, “it’s all rot her saying the sweets
are eaten up, they’re in her drawer.”</p>

<p>Of course Tom came back with a handful
of chocolates to divide between himself and
Anne, having left another illusion behind
him.</p>

<p>We had great difficulty at first with nurses.
Personally I cannot bear the popsy-wopsy
nurse who is so popular with good mothers.
When I was interviewing nurses for Tom, I
brought him into the room and left him to
decide. He soon weeded out the sheep
from the goats. If the woman exclaimed
“Bless him! where is he?” I caught Tom’s
eye, and we said we were so sorry but we
were already in treaty with some one whom
we thought would be suitable. We dismissed
dozens in that way for the same fault.
I have been in other people’s nurseries, and
seen children huddled and poked and blessed
and poppeted into their clothes, marched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
off giggling, and brought back pouncing, their
words overridden by ejaculations and clatter.
Their upbringing reminds me of the comic
pudding in the pantomime that is tossed up
and beaten down, rolled in a dish with
the cat, and thrown at the policeman, all to
the accompaniment of a blaring orchestra
and incessant conversation. I chose my
present nurse on account of her opening remark
to Tom. “Come here, boy,” she said,
and Tom went, and has remained ever since.</p>

<p>There were a great number of things she
“didn’t hold with,” but they were not matters
I was tenacious about myself, neither was
Tom, so we let them drop. Later on I found
that a certain amount of compromise was
effected, such as a pair of dried ears exchanged
for a short story before the fire, or some real
tea offered for a quiet afternoon with a scrap-book;
that was on days when Tom had
Satan in one pocket and an Angel of Goodness
in the other. He was a simple creature, and
but for Anne would have kept his illusions
much longer than he did. He thought that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
when he gave up his time to help in laying
the nursery tea, things got on quicker than
they would otherwise have done; that it
saved nurse trouble to hand the spoons to
him one by one and put them straight afterwards.
Anne found for herself an occupation
that she preferred.</p>

<p>One of nurse’s articles of faith was that
children should have their own place in the
household and keep to it. There was a
place for every one in her picture. The
servants in the kitchen, the children in
the nursery, the master in his study, and the
mistress in the drawing-room, also pervading
the whole house as, in a landscape, the sun
and the blizzard pervade fields, lakes, woods,
and mountains alike. To have the children
the centre of general attention or running
about the house would have seemed to her
as revolutionary as trees planted on a dinner-table
or poultry at large on a cricket-field.
Tom’s instincts led him to fall very easily
into his place in the domestic world. He was
always a mere nut in a vast mechanism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
whose existence he dimly apprehended; he
was of importance inasmuch as the great
machinery might go out of gear for want of
the trustworthy service of the least of its
parts. Anne thought of herself—so far as
she thought at all—as a spark from a divine
fire, sent to illumine the musty darkness in
which parents, domestic servants, visitors, and
tradesmen had hitherto lived. This divine
spark must be kept alive. She encouraged
us all to blow, and herself pirouetted helpfully
in the draught of our exertions. Nurse
never devised things for the children to do,
any more than the nervous system of the
body devises occupations for the other parts.
I understand that it allows some activities
to pass unnoticed, inhibits others, and encourages
some, but it does not suggest much.
We all had our work to do, and when nurse
was out of order, whether through ill-health or
disapproval, strange distempers appeared in
our conduct. Tom and Anne quarrelled.
Ruth took to sending up twice a week “that
sloppy hotpot which I can’t think is good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
for the children.” Clara left the clean things
from the wash downstairs, “getting in all
the way of the dust, and I with the stockings
yet to darn.” Even the fish surpassed
itself in evil-doing. Of course it “never
came,” we were used to that; but on these
fatal occasions it was full of bones when it
did come, and “had nothing on it.”</p>

<p>The children never got on with the
efficient female, Tom the least of the two,
owing to his illusions. Not that he disliked
her, he was always patient with women, and
prepared to think they were doing their best
(until Anne explained to him just what they
were doing), but the efficient female got in
his way, and made him hot. She brought
him occupations when he was already busy
with string. They were always in boxes
labelled “The Young So-and-so” (none of
them people whom he liked to be). He
never wanted to be a young designer or penman
or weaver. If she had brought materials
for the young plumber—a pound of lead for
instance, or that delightful gas thing on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
stick that makes a flame when you blow—it
would not have been so bad; he could have
mended the hole in nurse’s boot, or stopped
up the place under the coal-scuttle where
the mouse came. The efficient female
believed in Madame Montessori’s Kindergarten
apparatus in the same spirit as the poor
believe in the efficacy of a “bottle from the
doctor’s.” She brought us puzzles over
which we all tore our hair in the evenings.
Matching colours became an obsession, and
James began to button and unbutton his
waistcoat at dinner until I had to speak to
him on account of Clara. Finally nurse came
to the rescue, as usual, and inhibited our desire
to cultivate our senses. She complained that
Tom had awakened her by trying to fit each
of his fingers successively into her open
mouth, and that he was quite feverish because
none of them fitted exactly. The efficient
female told me what a great success the
system had been with her children; but the
truth is that I do not like her children. They
have their hair tied in an unbecoming way,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
they can tell you the names of all the flowers
in the garden—even the flowering shrubs
which no decent person ever remembers—they
know what makes the hen lay eggs, and
why their own tears are salt. When I was
young, we knew less about ourselves and
more about other people. We ranged over
the whole field of history, picking out gems
of character here and there. Quintus
Curtius, Noah, Henry the Eighth and his six
wives, Napoleon in the retreat from Moscow
(there was a picture of it in the nursery, with
snow, and vultures, and corpses lying across
broken cannon), Marius amongst the ruins
of Carthage, the Queen of Sheba, King
Alfred, Livingstone, Cardinal Wolsey. We
remembered none of their dates, neither was
their history correlated with other subjects,
but we shall have to mix them up in heaven.
So why not now? One has friends of various
ages, yet it never occurs to me to mention: “Of
course you were born before the death of Gladstone,
were you not? I want to introduce Mrs.
Ingram, born 1856, contemporary with Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
Maybrick, the famous poisoner; in politics,
Churchill, Chamberlain, and Balfour; science,
Marconi and the close of the reign of Lister;
saw the dawn of motor-cars, and remembers
the introduction of the telephone.” Or,
“Miss Black, born shortly before the accession
of Lloyd George, witnessed the ascent of the
first aeroplane, and took a prominent part in
the famous raid by Suffragettes on the House of
Commons.” A correlated introduction would,
I imagine, be made like this: “Miss Black,
a descendant of the Black Prince, has crossed
the Black Sea twice, wears black stockings,
and is interested in nigger minstrelsy.”</p>

<p>My whole sympathy is with that little boy
who, having learned the anatomy of the
snowdrop, washed-in the snowdrop in bold
outline, modelled the snowdrop, sung a song
about the snowdrop, found on the map the
different countries where it grew, and
learned the best of those passages in literature
where it is mentioned, at last flung the
detestable little flower to the ground, exclaiming
heartily, “Damn the snowdrop!”</p>

</div>


<p>When Tom was seven and Anne
nine, I decided to engage a
governess. I had never lost the
feeling of—shall we call it respect—that I
had felt for my own governess; one does
not lose a feeling like respect in ten years.
Therefore, when I found myself interviewing
a governess for some one else, I felt rather
like a sheep engaging a butcher. You can
picture the scene. A small office adjoining
the shambles. The sheep, arrayed in all the
panoply of its natural wool unshorn for
many years, the place where the branded
mark had been covered with a self-possessed
growth, seated at a small table writing.
The pen a fancy article in the humorous
disguise of a knife.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Jones,” says the trembling,
bleating voice. “Do you kill yourself, or do
you purchase the—er—the carcasses? You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
were in your last shop how many years?
Precisely—very painful—thank you. You
left on account of an outbreak of anthrax
amongst the lambs—quite so. Yes, you
would have the dip to yourself after ten
o’clock. The slaughter-house is next door
to your room, and there is a convenient
tannery within ten minutes’ walk kept by an
excellent ogre with moderate charges; we
are devoted to him. I will send the cart to
the station for you on Tuesday, and you will
be able to begin your rounds at once.”</p>

<p>I lost this feeling after I had been to one
or two agencies, and I felt instead like the
man with a whip, who took over the plantation
from the kind master in “Uncle Tom’s
Cabin.” Innocent old ladies with white
wool on their heads and Bibles in their
pockets came to offer their services as
educational drudges, prepared to expose their
pathetic cashmere backs to the lash of
childish criticism and motherly arrogance.
I wanted to engage them all just to ensure
their being out of reach of some women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
I knew. I would then leave them my house,
and fly with Tom and Anne to some desert
island where we never need employ anyone
or improve our minds again.</p>

<p>But it was impossible to engage them all,
so I tossed up in the end between two;
“heads,” Miss Mathers, “tails,” Miss Cook,
and Miss Mathers had it. Miss Cook was
young and modern, very pretty and charming,
with all the drawbacks of a boy and a few of
his advantages. I knew the children would
get on with her, but I had a secret fear that
she would think me “quaint,” and perhaps
develop an enthusiasm for my vices, which
would have bothered me. Miss Mathers
was above all things a gentlewoman, which I
thought would be good for Anne because I
was not. She liked refinement and regular
hours, and, especially, her attitude towards
“gentlemen” was such a delight to me.</p>

<p>“Have you ever had brothers, Miss
Mathers?” I asked her once, to which she
replied: “Oh, yes, I have a brother I am
extremely fond of; he is a most delightful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
man, so honest, generous, and witty. We
have been the greatest of friends ever since
our childhood.”</p>

<p>“But, then, surely, you must have seen
him in his shirt-sleeves sometimes,” I suggested,
“you know he is a human being
and not a strange animal. Didn’t you ever
sit on his knee?”</p>

<p>“No, Mrs. Molyneux,” she said after
some thought, “I don’t remember ever
doing so; I doubt whether he would have
cared for it. But, of course, if anything of
the kind had been necessary I should not
have hesitated.”</p>

<p>I found great tonic properties in Miss
Mathers’ conversation, for I had never seen
men and women separated in the way
she did it. It made exquisitely amusing so
much in our social life that had been dull
before. To her mind, so far as I understand,
a man’s position in the scheme of creation
is like that of the architect when a house is
to be built. The only person who really
matters is the lady who lives in the house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
when it is complete. The architect (it is
disagreeable of course to have to employ one)
merely sees that it is there. He is the man
who does all the necessary and unpleasant
part, what Miss Mathers called in every
branch of art “the mechanical part.” I
have heard her say of a picture that the
“mechanical part was very nicely done.” I
think her opinion of James was high, inasmuch
as she considered his share in the
establishment—the mechanical part—was
very nicely done. That is, there was enough
money to live on, the servants were well
looked after, his children healthy, affectionate,
and not too numerous.</p>

<p>But, while I was looked upon as a fellow-creature,
James was to her a thing as utterly
remote as the driver of a train in which she
might be travelling, or, as I said, the architect
of our house or the Archbishop of
Canterbury. No, I think that is wrong. The
Archbishop would be thought more human
being a clergyman, because clergymen are
almost like ladies they are so sensible—we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
will say, rather, the Pope, because being
a Roman Catholic he was, of course, not
a clergyman, though no doubt an excellent
man according to his lights.</p>

<p>Miss Mathers was full of pleasant surprises.
I found that she enjoyed music-halls,
approved of divorce (which she called a
capital arrangement if two people could not
agree), and disliked the idea of Women’s
Suffrage. I pointed out that she was inconsistent
in approving of divorce notwithstanding
her religious principles, and she
explained her reasons over some hot buttered
toast before retiring to bed.</p>

<p>“My brother divorced his wife,” she said,
“for reasons which are warranted by Scripture,
and I hold him to be in the right. It
was far better than if he had compelled her
to live with him under false pretences of
affection.”</p>

<p>“But if she ran away,” I suggested.</p>

<p>“In that case,” said Miss Mathers, “she
would have continued to bear his name, and
would therefore have been living in open sin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
My brother, by taking the course he did,
gave her the opportunity to retrieve her
character by becoming respectably married.
The Church is perfectly right in refusing to
sanction divorce, because persons who place
themselves in such a position ought to
be outside the pale of religion, but I think
the law acts wisely in providing for legitimate
separation.”</p>

<p>On another buttered toast night I asked
her why she disliked Women’s Suffrage. If
I had had any knowledge of character I
might have guessed her reason, but Miss
Mathers was not like anyone I had met
before.</p>

<p>“My dear Mrs. Molyneux,” she said,
“the poet Byron has most truly observed
that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘<i>Man’s love is of his life a thing apart;</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>’Tis woman’s whole existence.</i>’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is true that it does not fall to the lot of all
of us to love in that sense, but the possibility
can never be lost sight of. What could you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
conceive more ludicrous and unsuitable than
that the whole existence of one of our rulers
should be merged in passionate feelings for a
fellow-creature? Public life demands whole-hearted
devotion to the State.”</p>

<p>“But great statesmen often fall dreadfully
in love,” I said.</p>

<p>“A thing apart, Mrs. Molyneux, believe
me,” the romantic creature said with assurance.
“When my brother’s nose is in his books or
his inkpot or wherever else it may happen to
be, it is <i>there</i>; temporarily perhaps, but he
gives his whole mind to it. When he emerges
he may be the slave of any woman, only not
at the time. But I assure you I have seen
women attempt to transact the business of an
office, when they were in love, with deplorable
results. I do not say they are incapable of
renouncing their private passions for the sake
of what they apprehend to be their duty, but
I maintain that their services to that duty
will not be worth a pin so long as the renouncement
is in progress. And the public
service cannot wait while they recover.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>“A great many people will disagree with
you, Miss Mathers,” I said.</p>

<p>“A great many people have not loved,”
she replied. “I speak from observation
only.”</p>

<p>Tom and Anne were as devoted as I was
to Miss Mathers. Of course Anne never
became a gentlewoman, but she learned to
sew, and to write without inking her fingers,
not to come into a room head first and feet
last nor to trail a vanishing hand across the
door before she shut it; not to giggle, not
to finger the spoons and forks before the next
dish came in, not to sit still when she ought
to stand up, not to frown and show her
teeth in the sun, not to fall into habits of
speech, and—most valuable and delightful
accomplishment—not to argue about anything
that had to be done. Tom said Miss
Mathers was very restful because she saved
them so much trouble. He explained that
so long as there was any chance of altering
an order by discussion it would be unsporting
not to have a shot at it, but the argument<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
was, on the whole, more fatiguing than it was
worth, even to gain a slight concession.</p>

<p>I do not know whether she returned our
affection, but when she left because Anne
grew up, she said she did not intend to teach
any more. It was very up-hill work in the
present state of affairs. Parents of breeding
were dying out, and modern education
appeared to become daily more medical and
less moral. She could never acquire the
requisite knowledge for turning out a child’s
stomach to examine its character. She
should, therefore, retire and live with her
brother, who really needed a lady to look
after him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X_THE"><i>CHAPTER X</i>: THE
CHARWOMAN</h2>
</div>


<p>Two-and-sixpence a day is
what it costs me to have the
pleasure of Mrs. Muff’s society.
She came at half-past eight and began at once
on a bit of breakfast.</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, m’m,” said Ruth, when
Mrs. Muff had been with us for a week
(she came on Mondays and Tuesdays and
did the rough washing), “but do I understand
that Mrs. Muff is to have anything
special ordered in for her breakfast?”</p>

<p>“It depends,” I said. “Is a charwoman
fed on special food like a gold-fish? Won’t
she thrive unless we give her ant’s eggs or
boiled Indian meal?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t say, I’m sure, m’m.” Ruth
glanced angrily in the direction of the washhouse
where Mrs. Muff was urging us in
quavering tones to abide with her. “She
had an egg this morning like the rest of us,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
but she said she wouldn’t be responsible if
it happened again, as they always disagreed
with her.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but these are fresh ones,” I said.
“Did you explain it to her? Perhaps she had
never tried them before; it makes all the
difference.”</p>

<p>Ruth suggested that I had better speak to
her myself, so I gathered up my skirts and
“webbed it,” as an elegant friend of mine
puts it, over the wet floor to Mrs. Muff and
touched her on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mrs. Muff,” I shouted.
The song ceased. An amiable little cherry
face with a sharp nose, vegetable eyes, and
four teeth, by no means whole, whisked
round upon me out of the steam.</p>

<p>“I can only abide with you for a minute,
dear Mrs. Muff,” I bawled, “but I came
to ask whether you had everything you
wanted.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, thank you, m’m, indeed—unless
it were that you could see your way to a
new wash-tub; this one leaks something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
awful. If you thought of getting a man in
to see to it he would tell you.”</p>

<p>“I know what he would tell me,” I replied,
“I say—I know what he would tell me.
I have heard it before.”</p>

<p>“And what was that, m’m?” Mrs. Muff
inquired intelligently with one dripping hand
behind her ear.</p>

<p>“I can’t explain,” I shouted, “it would
take too long, but it made him whistle a
great deal, and I don’t think the whistling
did the tub any good, so we got a new one,
and that is the one you are using—it is quite
new—I can’t get another just yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, quite so, m’m, quite so, I only
thought I would mention it. I can manage
splendidly, but this soap don’t seem to get
up much of a lather. Where I was in my
last place I did all the master’s shirts, and
the table-cloths, and the sheets, and the
pillow-cases. I made a splendid job of it;
got a fine lather we did, and all with Cross
and Blackwell’s soap, nothing else; I never
put nothing to it, no soda nor chemicals; I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
don’t hold with them. Just the plain soap.
Now I’ll just show you this soap if you can
be troubled—beg pardon, it’s me left ear—if
you’ll excuse me I’ll turn round—now
then, what was it, m’m?”</p>

<p>“By and by,” I screamed, “but what
about your breakfast?”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you trouble about that, m’m,”
she assured me, “anything will do for me.
Just what you are having yourselves, m’m.
A bit of bread is all I need. I always say
so long as we ’ave bread we’ve no need to
complain. It’s a pity you don’t ’appen to
have a better drying ground, isn’t it, m’m?
You could do with a nice field. Always
seems to make the things sweeter to my
mind with plenty o’ fresh air; but, bless
you, I can manage. I’ll give them an extra
rub and they’ll look every bit as well. I’m
accustomed to make things do as best I can,
with me ’usband being an invalid. I was a
splendid cook at one time, used to cook
every bit of what ’e ’ad, I did indeed, and
wash too—washed everything for the children—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
in me last place we ’ad everything to
do, the table-cloths, and the sheets, and
the——”</p>

<p>The washhouse was full of steam, so she
did not notice my escape. Through the
open window I could hear that she supposed
me to be still with her. Presently there
was an abrupt pause and the hymn began
again.</p>

<p>I told Ruth next morning that I thought
she had misjudged Mrs. Muff; she seemed
a good-natured old lady, and used to putting
up with things. I was informed that she
had carried on something dreadful that
morning, wanting three courses for breakfast,
besides jam and coffee; said tea wasn’t fit
stuff to begin the day on, there was nothing
strengthening about it. “And she’s calling
the soap for everything,” Ruth added; “says
she can’t wash with it, and there is no place
to dry the clothes—perhaps you wouldn’t
mind speaking to her.”</p>

<p>She was out on the back lawn this time
hanging out the clothes. Some eccentric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
flannel garments flaunted defiance, with one
leg in the air, and Mrs. Muff sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>At the sign of triumph</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent4"><i>Satan’s host doth flee——</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Certainly it does,” I said to myself, and
turning up my sleeves I walked out.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Muff,” I began, “what is all this
again about breakfast and soap?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Muff in tears was worse than anything
I had imagined to be possible. The
only thought that enabled me to proceed
was that Ruth in tears would be less harrowing
but far more terrible. As usual, pity
was conquered by fear, and I saw myself as
an egg-thirsty tyrant standing (with Ruth
behind me) belabouring the prostrate body
of poor musical Mrs. Muff with a bar of
Gossage’s Tallow Crown. Neither “Primrose
Glory” (I think that was the name of
her soap) nor fried fish were ever mentioned
between us again. Ruth generously added
half a cold pie to the peace contract, and I
contributed a blue serge suit dear to James’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
heart. It is always satisfactory to work in
minor interests with great ones and to
combine generosity with one’s own advantage.</p>

<p>Imagination is sometimes thought to belong
to a high order of intelligence. I
believe it often depends upon absence of
education. A great mind may so use its
education that it only provides a wider field
for the imagination, just as the marvellous
digestion of a goat can adapt all sorts of
inedible stuff to a useful end, but it is
difficult to improve on the brilliant fancy of
quite ordinary children and illiterate old
ladies. If Mrs. Muff had had a normally
adult intelligence or the least smattering of
science, she would never have expected me
to believe that the numerous handkerchiefs
that got lost in the wash had gone down the
grid. We lost six in one week and ten in
the next, and still the water flowed peacefully
away, nor ever tarried for a moment round
Mrs. Muff’s ill-protected roots. I gave
orders that if she would make such a mess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
she must stand on a foot-stool, which she
reluctantly did; but if her explanation about
the grid had contained a tenth part of fact
she would have been standing knee-deep in
a lake in no time. If Mrs. Muff had not
been so deaf I should have told her some of the
explanations that I have heard children give
for natural phenomena, and asked whether
they seemed to her at all remarkable. A
nice child of my acquaintance, who invariably
comes to dinner with dirty finger-nails, has
given me quite a lot of imaginative pleasure.
Once (she was reproved and sent back each
time) it was the cold weather that had made
them black; another day—the next, I believe—it
was the thunder; the last time I went
there to lunch it was because she had been
hanging down her hands, and her mother
commented upon the curious fact that the
week before it had been because she was
reaching up to do her hair. I myself have
been told that the plates were sooty because
the plumber was in the house, that the fresh
eggs were bad because of the time of year,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
and I have waited to complete my collection
of “facts that every housewife ought to
know,” until I am assured that the cat has
had an unusual number of kittens on account
of the range.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI_HUSBANDS"><i>CHAPTER XI</i>: HUSBANDS</h2>
</div>


<p>To those about to marry a husband
often seems not only a subject for
affection and admiration but also
for respect such as is given to an older and
more experienced being. The young bride
sees herself in imagination the possessor of a
husband and children; she classifies them
as belonging to separate orders of being.
This I have found to be a mistake, but many
of us drift so gently into a knowledge of the
fact that we never notice how far we have
wandered from our original conception. I
realised the position quite suddenly one day.
There was no falling apple nor boiling tea-kettle
nor anything of that sort to start the
theory in my head; it was not even as if I
had been cutting down James’s trousers to fit
Tom. I had been sitting with my hands in
my lap, twiddling my thumbs, when all of a
sudden this occurred to me. “James is to
the other children what the thumb is to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
other fingers. I have five fingers, the most
powerful and useful of which stands apart
from the others and is called the thumb. I
have five children of which the first, the
most powerful and useful, is called the
husband. I have been deceived by instinct,
by tradition, and by my parents, and it does
not matter in the least; things are exactly as
they were before. I will brush my husband’s
hat and think no more about it.” But I did
think more about it. I began also to notice
other ladies in the same predicament, and
marked how unconscious they were of their
true position. I watched them feed and
dress and exercise their first-born husbands,
observing how they advised and reproved
and deceived them for their good, how they
encouraged them to work and were surprised
when the work was recognised and paid for
by the world. Mrs. Beehive’s husband was
rather celebrated. He had built a great
many public buildings, she once told me with
pride and in just the same way as she
described how baby had begun to take notice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
at an exceptionally early age. I could hear
her, in imagination, say, “Yes, dear, very nice
indeed,” while Mr. Beehive toiled and built
like the dearest and humblest of beavers that
he is, occasionally reviving his hopeful efforts
to explain the nature of creation to the
passive, mutton-headed creature who has, so
to speak, swallowed him up and borne him
anew for herself against his will. Another
thing I discovered was that Ruth knew what a
husband is and never told me. Servants are
much sharper than their mistresses about
these things. I suppose it is because they
are not distracted by love and marriage. In
their minds the master and the children are
lumped together with other troublesome and
necessary facts which girls have to put up
with. (Whether they are “Mother’s” husband
and children or the mistress’s makes very
little difference.) They want a great deal
more cooking than anyone would do for
themselves, they tear their clothes, and are
unpunctual and passionate. Sometimes they
come home drunk and use up the money<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
that is wanted for the house, or they speculate
and gamble with it—silly fellows—instead
of laying it out sensibly on bargains
and outings. The only excuse they might
have for doing the things they do—littering
up the place with books and papers and
musical instruments, screaming at one another
without their hats in the street, or sitting in
poky rooms in their shirt-sleeves—the only
excuse they might have for all this folly would
be to get well paid for it, so that they might
spend at least part of the day sensibly in
dancing and holiday-making. But not at all.
They come home either as surly as bears or
else perfectly limp and useless for conversation,
they want more cooking done, and
probably have less money on them than they
took out. That is Ruth’s view I know, and
it is that, secretly or avowed, of all the
experienced women of good repute whom I
know; those who think otherwise are not
wives at heart, they are on a par with, if
they are not actually, concubines. Soon
after the day when I had twiddled my fingers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
and thought of these things, I began to
notice all sorts of little contributory facts
which fitted in with my newly formed
theory. What Ruth said was nothing new,
but I had never understood it before. I
went into the kitchen, as usual, to go through
the ceremony which Tom calls “seeing the
beef.” I had been out alone the evening
before, and had left a chop for James’s
dinner.</p>

<p>“There is very little of the cold grouse left,
m’m,” said Ruth, “the master’s been at it.”</p>

<p>“But I left a chop for him, didn’t I?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes’m, but he’s been at the grouse all the
same. He would have it. You can see for
yourself.”</p>

<p>Yes, I thought, if things were not as I now
see they are, Ruth would have spoken
differently. She would have said: “I am
sorry, m’m, I can’t let you have the grouse
to-day, but it was required for the master.”
As it is, the very servants can evidently see
no difference between the master wanting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
cold grouse and the boys raiding the pantry
for tarts. Where is my husband? It appears
that I have not got one. There is no such
thing.</p>

<p>I then remembered with painful feelings
of disillusionment something that Clara had
said a few days before. “The master’s vests,
m’m, they are all out at the elbows, with him
yawning like that. He pulls them to pieces
every time he raises his arms. I wonder
could you speak to him about it?”</p>

<p>“He only yawns like that when he is
doing very difficult work, Clara,” I said at
the time. “We can’t help it; it wouldn’t
do to interrupt him.”</p>

<p>“No, m’m, but if you could just mention
it to him—you see it takes me all the evening
to mend them when I ought to be getting
on with the new curtains.” It was just as if
she had said: “Of course, it is a pity he
shouldn’t enjoy himself, and I would be the
last to wish to stop it, but we can’t let his play
stand in the way of what has to be done.”</p>

<p>The idea of a wife being the mother of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
her husband is an old one, but it has been too
ambiguously put before the public, therefore
girls still marry under a misapprehension.
The misapprehension is of no consequence
and hurts no one, but I cannot help thinking
it would save disappointment if instead of
nursing a delusion we could idealise a fact.
If children were not made unnecessarily
ridiculous the supposed husband would not
be missed from the family group. If Mrs.
Beehive gave to her younger children some
of the dignity which she has, by reason of
her nature, stripped from Mr. Beehive it
would be a great deal better than throwing
it away, and Mr. Beehive would suffer less
from being placed in the same pigeon-hole
with his own baby. Why should the mother
of the family be the only one who is allowed
any dignity or private life? She denies this,
of course, and draws you a beautiful fancy
picture of papa, the head of the house. She
dresses him up for your benefit in all his
war-paint of waistcoat and whiskers, but she
does it in just the same spirit as she dresses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
up her son as a postman to please him while
she gets on with her work. And the cruel
thing is that she has so long ago stripped
him of his natural fur and feathers that when
she says “that is enough,” and folds away
the waistcoat and whiskers in a drawer, he is
exposed to the neighbours in a defenceless
and absurd condition.</p>

<p>What is it that binds Mr. and Mrs. Beehive
together? The problem has fidgeted
me for years. It has disturbed me in my
work, and sometimes even caused me to overlook
Mr. Jones’s iniquities until it was too late
to do anything. I once asked Ruth why it is
that married people remain with one another,
and she said she supposed it was the evenings.</p>

<p>“What about the evenings?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, m’m,” she said, “as you
know yourself, there is not very much for
unmarried girls as is anyways respectable
to do in the evenings.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but the men, Ruth,” I said,“—mind
the milk—it is boiling—thank you—why
do they stay to be treated like children?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>“Well, m’m, I suppose it is because they
are what you might call childish. Of course,
you may say they do bring in the money,
and some of them are very knowledgeable—such
as master—but you’ll find they haven’t
much idea of spending an evening profitably
without they are married.”</p>

<p><i>It wouldn’t do to let them know</i>, is a great
phrase in every peaceful household. And it
is quite true; it would never do at all.
Husbands want reasons for everything and
we know what that means! It is impossible
to make them understand why some perfectly
ordinary things cannot be done. We say,
perhaps, light-heartedly enough, “I have
such a headache, I wish I hadn’t to go out!”
and he says, “Well, why do you go out?”
Of course we reply that there is the fish to be
got—it never came—and then it is his turn
to say, “Why not send Ruth?” We explain
that Ruth has to cook the dinner.</p>

<p>“But she can’t cook the fish before it
comes.”</p>

<p>“But there are the other things?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, never mind them, your head is
the only thing that matters. Let Ruth go.”</p>

<p>We end by a detailed description of the
cook’s afternoon and the havoc this slight
disorganisation of the traffic would cause,
knowing, of course, perfectly well that there
is no reason why Ruth should not go except
that she just can’t. Cooks don’t go for fish
unless they offer to, and then they are
not experienced enough. What we really
want the man to do is to say he will go, but
we don’t say this because it would end in his
sending Ruth and thinking himself very
clever. He would report that she was
delighted to go and made no fuss whatever.
Next day we should be made to feel that the
unwritten law had been broken through our
fault. We had taken a mean refuge behind
the master, whose orders she could not refuse
to obey. Things would be very uncomfortable
for some time and she would very
likely ask whether the master were going to
undertake the housekeeping, because if so—etc.
But it is impossible to explain all that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
at the time, so we are either cross because
of the headache and conceal the cause, or
else we are rude at once when he begins
his suggestions, and then he says women
are unreasonable and ought to take more
exercise.</p>

<p>I seem always to be exploding fallacies in
this book, but there is one more which must
be mentioned because it is connected with
the husband fallacy. It is part of Mrs.
Beehive’s whisker make-up. This is the
fallacy of the Experienced Man. I have
never yet seen a man who gave me the
impression of being in the least experienced
in anything more important than the details
of his own business. In matters of life and
death he is as hopeful at eighty as he was at
eight. James still says to me: “What a good
plan it would be to share a house for the
summer with the Van Diemans. You see,
they would not be in our way in the least;
they would have rooms to themselves, we
needn’t see them unless we want to. He
would be there to fish and play golf with me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
and you would be left with her. She would
probably do the housekeeping for you.”</p>

<p>The last time he mentioned this I said:
“Do you ever go to stay with anyone without
hiding at the top of the house and pretending
you are dead for nine-tenths of the day?”
He said no, but that was different—when you
had rooms of your own. I replied: “Do you
know what you would do? You would open
the door of our sitting-room as you came
upstairs and say: ‘Why not come in and
have a chat and a smoke?’ The poor
deluded dears would come in, you would be
as pleased as Punch for ten minutes and then
begin to fidget.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but then they would go,” said
James, “and besides I like it for much
longer than that.”</p>

<p>“You don’t, ten minutes is the outside
limit. I have timed you often when the
Van Diemans have been here: in ten minutes
you begin to wind up your watch and ask
where they are going to spend Christmas.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do I?” said James.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, and another thing, you don’t like
fishing. It is the idea of fishing that you
like. When it comes to the point you go
because Van Dieman is such a good chap,
but you hate the wet grass, and the flies, and
not catching anything.”</p>

<p>“What a sordid mind for detail you have,”
he said; “there is no imagination about you.”</p>

<p>“An ounce of experience is worth two
pounds of imagination,” I answered.</p>

<p>We took our holiday in an altogether
different way, and James was appalled when
the Van Diemans told him how they had
spent their time. He said it was inconceivable
how people could enjoy that sort of
thing. When I pointed out that it was
entirely owing to my foresight and intelligence
that we had not been there, he said
shamelessly that it would have been quite
different if we had gone; it was just an
accident that they had behaved in accordance
with their temperaments and their invariable
habit.</p>

<p>Women, on the other hand, are so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
experienced that I have begun to think they
remember not only their childhood but also
their previous incarnations. From what I
know of both sexes it seems probable that
Adam spat out his piece of apple behind the
nearest fig-tree, while Eve munched hers
conscientiously to the end and got some
good out of it. I used to consult Mrs.
Beehive in the early days about all sorts of
domestic matters, but finally I gave it up
because she was so depressing. She said so
often: “It’s no good, dear. It’s a nice idea,
I know, but you will find it will rot with
the sun,” and it always did, in spite of
Mr. Beehive saying that it was sure to do
beautifully, and that the reason why theirs
had been a failure was the unusual dampness
of the year; it was not likely to occur again.</p>

<p>Husbands seldom learn by experience
to recognise the object of their instinctive
desire. Just as a baby screams and reaches
towards the plant in the middle of the table
when it really needs to go into the kitchen
and ask cook for milk with a little water in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
it—not too hot—so a man says to his wife:
“I dislike your clothes intensely. I wish
you would go and buy a sort of shawl
arrangement and drape it round you like the
figures you see on a Greek vase. That is
the way women ought to dress.” The poor
fish-faced lady with the innocent expression
and wispy hair goes obediently to Derry and
Toms’s and buys an expensive silk shawl
which she arranges round her ill-balanced
form in exact imitation of the lady on the
vase in Edward’s room, and comes down to
dinner. Then the real tragedy begins, and
all about a shawl! What he really had before
his mind was no more a shawl than it
was an Inverness cape or a Moujik’s jacket.
It was a confection which he had seen on a
lady in the Park with a beautiful figure, and
if his innocent old dear had bought the same
model and put it on he would have called
her shameless and abandoned. If he had
more experience and fewer childish dreams
he would address her as follows: “My
dear, I wish that you would not dress in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
parti-coloured scraps that don’t fit. I cannot
myself think what you would look nice in,
but first stand up straight and do your hair,
and then try on clothes until you find something
that I tell you is right.”</p>

<p>It is the folly of either side trying to explain
anything to the other that leads to
bloodshed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII_CHRISTMAS"><i>CHAPTER XII</i>: CHRISTMAS</h2>
</div>


<p>When I asked Ruth what about
Christmas, she said that it was
always a pleasant season and she
hoped none of us would break down; it meant
so much to do for all. So of course I asked
whether it would be any help to have in
Mrs. Muff to wash up while Ruth made the
puddings. She agreed that would probably
be the best plan, as it would be a pity if we
were not able to enjoy ourselves when it
came to the point. She herself was usually
at her wits’ end about Christmas-time.</p>

<p>“But you love that, Ruth!” I said
candidly, forgetting myself for the moment.</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, m’m?”</p>

<p>“It is your wits’ beginning that bothers
you, isn’t it?” I explained. “I mean”
(seeing her face darken) “it is a nuisance
thinking of things, I know, I feel it myself.
We shall be able to give our minds to it if
Mrs. Muff is here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>I then passed hastily on to other things:
the puddings, for instance, which took
complete possession of my kitchen for a
time. I do not think they became as
personal to Ruth as to me. For my taste
they were made too much of; they and
the mince-pies crowded out the place and I
was thankful to get rid of them. Long
before Christmas I looked forward to the
day when they all would be dead—“Arthur,
Henry, Claud, Stanley, Gordon, Livingstone,
Howard, Percy, George, Gerald, Trafford,
and Herbert,” I counted along the shelf,
“and all the little Thompsons. Arthur and
Henry we shall want for ourselves and the
kitchen on Christmas Day, you might give
Claud to Mrs. Muff, and let Mullins have
Stanley. Gordon and Livingstone are smaller
and will do for New Year’s Day, so that
leaves six to kill before Easter——” I caught
sight of Ruth’s face, pale and agitated. “I
am so sorry,” I apologised. “You know
they seem almost like children, we have
taken such an interest in them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>“Would you care for a cup of tea, m’m?”
Ruth asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“By and by,” I said. “I don’t really care
very much for food just now. What about
the turkey?”</p>

<p>“Well, m’m,” said Ruth, “a good-sized
one that would stuff nicely ought to do us
over Boxing Day, with a bit of beef, and
there will be all the sausages.”</p>

<p>I already began to feel fat and over-fed;
what with Claud and the others, and my
enemy the beef with all his sausages, besides
the stuffing, all arriving to lunch on the
same day. It was like a lot of fat people
driving over for tea and to spend the afternoon;
a thing I have always detested.</p>

<p>“Ruth,” I pleaded, “you don’t think we
might tell the tradespeople that of course
one makes allowances at Christmas when
every one is busy, so I should not be too exacting
if one or two things—the sausages for
instance—never came?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, m’m,” she said proudly, “they’d
never disappoint us at Christmas!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>“Ruth, I have hit upon a profound
truth!” I exclaimed. “There is nothing
the matter with sin in itself. The only
thing that makes the Devil a bad man is
that he misbehaves at the wrong time and
in the wrong place. Think of the praiseworthy
murders that might be committed
on the right people, the thefts of horrible
objects from the home that would reform
humanity; arson if committed on the right
kind of shops——” Ruth was running the
taps for the washing-up and did not hear a
word I said, so I left her and went upstairs
to elaborate my theory of sin and write to
Mrs. Muff. I allowed Ruth to arrange
what food she liked during the next few
days, as the kitchen was uninhabitable.
They were giving the place a good clean
down, she said. The open door disclosed
Mrs. Muff singing hymns on a cork island
in the middle of a flood, and an army of
evicted beetles trying to settle their families
into new quarters before Christmas, while
Ruth and the range (clasped in one another’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
arms, like the victims of Pompeii) breathed
mutual forgiveness in a volcanic darkness of
dust and ashes. I went out and met the
efficient female coming back from town.</p>

<p>“I suppose you have done all your Christmas
shopping?” she observed. “I always like
to get mine done before the rush begins.”</p>

<p>“I am waiting for the London catalogues,”
I said. “It is such a good way to shop.”</p>

<p>She told, as she had done before, how
far more satisfactory it is to shop in person.
“They put you off with anything if you
leave it to them,” etc. I pointed out that
with things like soap, and scent, and foie
gras, and postage stamps, which are what
I generally give people, there is not a wide
field for the discretion of the shopman. She
was so genuinely grieved at my idea of
presents, and I know that she is such a good
woman, understanding the public taste, and
so on (besides, the catalogues had not come),
that I thought it might be fun to try her
way and see what it was like.</p>

<p>I turned into the principal street where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
the windows were full of suggestions:
“Christmas novelties,” “Serviceable Xmas
presents,” “What about the boys? Boots’
marvellous cash sponge always in request.”
I bought some things marked “three-eleven-three,”
and thought I was doing very well to
secure them, as there were only a few. A
little farther down the street I saw a great
many more of the same things, only they
were marked “one-eleven-three,” and looked
in better condition. I went home and
rearranged my list of people so as to use up
some of the inferior “three-eleven-threes.”
“I will take away Cousin Jemima’s soup-bowl,”
I thought, “and give her one of the
spare three-eleven-threes, then Pauline can
have the soup-bowl and I will give her pencil-case
to Jimmy Duncan, because his mother
has taken me out so often.”</p>

<p>Next day I came upon a shop in a back
street—it was in the Chinese quarter of the
town. There were the most beautiful blue
and yellow fruit plates and dishes, enough to
make a thousand homes happy. They were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
so pretty that I danced with rage upon the
pavement. I bought all I wanted and rearranged
my list for the third time. It
was getting dreadfully expensive. Cousin
Jemima’s “three-eleven-three” had left her
now, and she had been reduced to a pin-cushion
at ninepence-halfpenny. Pauline’s soup-bowl
was exchanged for a set of fruit-dishes
which were much nicer, and then I remembered
that she wanted one of my new photographs.
I had ordered a dozen and they
must be disposed of. I went home and
rearranged my list again, which left me with
two glass powder-boxes over.</p>

<p>When James came in and said, “Have you
thought at all about Christmas presents?”
I could scarcely answer coherently. He
asked whether I could spare him any, and I
told him that there were two powder-boxes
he could have with pleasure. But that was
no good, as none of his relations use powder.
It was early-closing day, so we could not get
anything else. He told me he had six boxes
of cigarettes that I might have for my people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
if I could let him have something more
suitable for his grandmother and the vicar’s
children, so I gave him Pauline’s children’s
sweets, and Cousin Jemima’s pin-cushion, and
some of the Chinese dishes, and began all
over again. This time there were three
powder-boxes left, and my godson and James’s
uncle were unprovided for. (James’s uncle
was in a nursing home, so it was particularly
important that he should have a cheery
Christmas.) I suggested that we should tell
him I was sending a photograph, but that
James had spilt ink on it and I had ordered
another specially, which would come in a few
days. Meantime we were sending a powder-box
to each of his nurses. “He will have a
much gayer time like that than with ordinary
presents,” I added hopefully. Clara came in
then and said that Mullins had finished putting
up the holly, and was there any message.</p>

<p>“I believe that the orthodox Christmas
message is Peace and Goodwill,” I said.
“Tell Mullins that I wish him peace and
shall be glad of some myself.” Clara withdrew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
with the message, but came back to say
that Mullins wished us both the compliments
of the season, and was there anything else?
I had only two halfpennies left, so I told
Clara to tell him that if he were as wise as
he pretended to be it was his part to bring
gold at Christmas, not to ask for it, but that
there was a small bottle of myrrh in the bathroom——However,
James said I was not to be
silly, so we borrowed a message from Ruth and
promised to pay her back in the morning if
she would get rid of Mullins. And then we
did up our parcels, all but the powder-boxes.
It was too late when I remembered that I
might have given one to Mullins; he could
have made himself look quite freshened up
for Christmas with it.</p>

<p>There was an extraordinary demand for
messages next day; even the lamplighter
and the dustman longed to hear what I had
to say. Some of them even sent books in
which to record the messages, and that did
it. “Mr. Jones’s book—and is there any
message, please?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>I forgot what I had said to Ruth about
forgiving Mr. Jones if he omitted to bring
the sausages and the stuffing. His record
for the past year was blacker than any recording
angel would have put up with. I tore
James’s fountain-pen from his pocket and
wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>When Jones’s villain asks to-day</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>A Christmas message, thou shalt say,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>‘Here is a shilling in my name.’</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Unfortunately it never came!</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On Christmas Eve parcels began to arrive.
Some were from people to whom, I remembered
with a pang, nothing had been
sent. The hopeless muddle of my scratched
list had resulted in some names passing
through my head without any definite settlement.
But there was still time. “Come to
the book-shop, quick!” I said to James.</p>

<p>We took a taxi and rattled to the book-shop;
but there—as the most unreasoning
person I know often says—“I lost my reason.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
James gave it the first flick by saying three
times, “Won’t they have read that?” I
was so irritated over the whole thing that I
said, unless he could manage to hurry up the
Day of Judgment before to-morrow, I couldn’t
possibly tell, after which he, very properly,
refused to help me. The counter was full of
books of a kind I never read, and detest to
look at: but I suppose some one reads them
or they would not be there. “Reminiscences
of a Conchologist,” “Historic Moments with
the Queens of Saxony” (this might be
amusing, but it wasn’t, because public
characters have a way of keeping their best
historic moments out of the press), “Leaves
from my Asparagus Bed,” by a lady gardener,
“Ad Nauseam” (this was bound in mauve
leather, cost eighteen pence and was of a
suitable size for packing, but I knew I could
not write a letter with it that would carry
conviction). James was fidgeting about the
shop all this time. “Do please find something
for Caroline,” I said to him.</p>

<p>“Just wait till I get this for the vicar,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
answered, hunting in his pocket. I asked
what it was and he held it up.</p>

<p>“But you can’t have that!” I said, “I
want it. It is the very thing for Caroline;
and the vicar won’t read it. Here! this is
much better for him.” I took up a book
with a beautiful picture on the cover. A
masked bishop digging up a corpse from the
hearthstone, under the very nose of an
expiring cook.</p>

<p>“The vicar is such a darling,” I said, “you
must give him something nice. He loves
excitement, and told me himself that the
lending libraries are so stupid; they send
him nothing but shop, and he does not know
what to ask for.”</p>

<p>James gave in, and, as it turned out, made
the success of the year with his present.
Caroline wrote me the warmest letter of
thanks for the book from which I had rescued
the vicar. It was a serious, blue cloth work
called “In Tune with the Indefinite.” She
is a thoroughly bad woman, as worldly as
Lot’s wife, and without a spark of generosity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
in her composition. She said she simply
loved mysticism, and had been wanting this
particular book ever since it came out.</p>

<p>I forgave Mr. Jones on Christmas Day
and tried to think well of Mullins and the
others. I also gave the boy half a crown on
the second of January, explaining that I was
sorry for the delay; there had been a slight
mistake as to the time for which it was
ordered. I hoped he would not be inconvenienced
by receiving it in the following
year instead.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII_THE_HOUSE"><i>CHAPTER XIII</i>: THE HOUSE
NEXT DOOR</h2>
</div>


<p>If I had been clairvoyant enough to foresee
the arrival of the Buttons in the
house next door, I should have looked
for another dumping-ground for my domestic
burdens, and, quite likely, have found myself
side by side with other and worse Buttons;
so I dare say it was for the best—or the least
bad anyhow. When we took our house
the adjoining Bijou was empty. I had forgotten
(being, as the efficient female says, a
little excitable) that it might some day be
filled.</p>

<p>We were very happy for two years; then
Satan began to find occupation for our landlord,
at whose bidding the Buttons sprang up
like fungus on the lawn of the empty house.
I came home after a short holiday to find
them thriving upon their evil juices. There
were then two parent Buttons and three
young ones. Six years later there were eight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
young ones, “and all by the same father,”
as a friend who was staying with us remarked
with surprise. In the mission field,
where I understand that human life is often
fostered for table purposes, the Buttons
would be invaluable, but for a civilised
country there were too many of them, added
to which (as it they wanted adding to!)
they kept animals and birds and every kind
of creature with a voice whom they could
lay hands on.</p>

<p>What deaf idiot can have floated the idea
of there being dumb animals in the world to
claim our affection and respect? When I
find a dumb animal I shall love it with all
my heart and soul. As for those animals
that already exist, it would be as reasonable
to speak with tears in our eyes about dumb
foreigners because they make life intolerable
with vociferations we do not understand.</p>

<p>I used to read books about the Great
African Silence, dreaming about it as a
Mussulman dreams of Paradise. If there is
a certain hour known as cock-crow why may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
not other hours be apportioned in the same
way and devoted to a particular animal? If this
were done I could arrange my day. I would
not go to bed until after cock-crow, I would
do my shopping at dog-bark, and arrange to
dine with a friend during caterwaul. As it is
there is no method about the nuisance; it is all
adrift and mixed up. And in the case of the
Buttons there were the children, who welded
single aggravations into one vast outrage.</p>

<p>They used to disperse themselves for conversation,
when reasonable people approach
one another. They planted one in the turret
at the top of the house, another at the bottom
of the garden, a third and fourth, within
quarrelable distance, at the drawing-room
window, while the fifth remained in a distant
potting-shed, and then they began; the
dumb animals acting as chorus.</p>

<p>“Ron——ald?” (From the turret.)</p>

<p>“Ye——s?”</p>

<p>“What are you doing?”</p>

<p>“Wh——at?”</p>

<p>“Wha——t—are—you—do——ing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>“Mending my boat.”</p>

<p>“Wha——t?”</p>

<p>“Men——ding—my—boa——t.”</p>

<p>“Mend——ing—your—wha——t?”</p>

<p>“My bo——at.”</p>

<p>“Your—co——at?”</p>

<p>“Bo——o——at.” (“Bow—bow—bow!——Bow—bow—bow!——Bouff!”)</p>

<p>“Down, Spot——Spot! Spot! Spot!”
(Whistling) “Peow, weow, weow——”</p>

<p>“Jimmy——”</p>

<p>“Wh——at?”</p>

<p>“Mother says, do you want your hammer?”</p>

<p>“Wh——at?”</p>

<p>“Mother says—do—you—want—your—hammer?”</p>

<p>(It would not be right to say what I did
with that hammer in my mind, because a
sin thought of is a sin committed in the eye
of Goodness.)</p>

<p>“I ca——n’—t he——a—r.”</p>

<p>“Kwakee—scrwaak.” (From the parrot.)</p>

<p>“Bow—bow—bow!——bow!——Bow—bow—bow!——bow!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>“Cock—a—doodle—do!”</p>

<p>“Co—rr——a—warra—corrawarra.”
(From the hen.)</p>

<p>Dog-bark and child-call lasted nearly
until cock-crow came round again, because
the Buttons, like the poor, keep their little
ones up rather late. They trundled rattly
things along the gravel, and joked loudly
with papa after he came home, until half-past
ten at night. We only needed cries of
“Salt!” “Herrings!” and “Murder!” to
give us the flavour of life at its fullest.</p>

<p>By way of side-shows there were the
gramophone, and the pianola, and the annual
baby (who never slept very well), and Mrs.
Button’s singing, and the flirtations of the
cook’s cat.</p>

<p>We enjoyed occasional precious lulls when
Mrs. Button had a baby or the children
were down with some disease. Even then
there were always a few who had recovered
first or who had not yet developed it; and
as the animals did not get infectious diseases,
and their confinements in no way interfered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
with their usual routine, the “Corrawarraing”
and “Cockadoodling” and “Bowing”
went on all the year round. It never
took Mrs. Button more than a fortnight to
have a baby, and during that time the
monthly nurse sang almost as loudly in the
garden as Mrs. Button used to do in the
drawing-room, so, altogether, the lulls did not
amount to very much. We always stayed
at home during the Buttons’ summer holiday
for the pleasure of being without them;
besides which, we got an extra month’s peace
by going away ourselves as soon as they came
back.</p>

<p>I never could see any point in the Button
family; they seemed to serve no useful end.
They fed, and moved about, and multiplied
exceedingly, yet never ate each other up, nor
burrowed, nor became destructive in their
neighbours’ gardens. But they were neither
grateful to the eye nor could they be used
for sport or for the table.</p>

<p>Mr. Button went every day to some
mysterious place of business, where persons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
gave him good money to do for them what
they could equally well have done for themselves;
it was probably dull work, and
Mr. Button did not mind doing it. It
suited both parties that the work should go
on, because the money they gave him made
it possible for him to go on being Mr.
Button, which was what he liked. Mrs.
Button also liked him to go on being what
he was, and they were so contented that they
continued to make more and more young
Buttons, just because it seemed a pity not to.
I am quite certain that was the only reason
that moved them to such an important
step.</p>

<p>I have never seen children who so clearly
as the young Buttons showed that it did not
matter in the least whose children they were,
any more than it matters which particular
couple of rabbits own the young ones
nibbling on the lawn. They were just
the young Buttons. If their parents had
happened to be the Duttons, or the Scruttons,
or the Muttons, it would have suited them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
quite as well—so long as cook didn’t leave.
That really would have mattered after she
had got into their ways.</p>

<p>I have known the Button family now for
some years, and never have I heard or seen
them do anything that could not have been
equally well said or done in a different way.
“It will do as well as any other” is a
favourite saying with all of them. Once,
when the Buttons were away, their life’s
history shaped itself in my thoughts, falling
more or less into rhyme because they are so
monotonous. There had been a new baby
lately, and the butcher’s cart was at the door
again:</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV_HOUSE-MOVING"><i>CHAPTER XIV</i>: HOUSE-MOVING</h2>
</div>


<p>I have heard Mrs. Beehive say of one
of our most prosperous neighbours that
they had “struggled up from the
Palmerston Road.” They were certainly a
little battered and jaded when they got
there: “there” being a handsome residential
mansion on the edge of the Park.
It has a tennis lawn, a vegetable garden, a
garage, four entertaining rooms, ten bedrooms,
butler’s pantry, electric light, ground-floor
kitchens, and every modern convenience—altogether
about as much material
for annoyance and waste of time as can well
be imagined. By the time Tom was sixteen
and Anne fourteen, our doom was
drawing near. In spite of my resistance,
James and I were about to struggle up from
the Palmerston Road; I saw it coming.
Our pleasant little house was falling to bits
over our heads. We were eight where we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
had been but four, and (this settled it) Ruth
was getting angry. She wanted help in the
kitchen, and there was nowhere to put any
help at night. James, too, was bothered
by the gramophone; Tom and Anne wanted
a tennis lawn; nurse wanted a room where
the dressmaker could sew (she made the
nursery floor so bitty). Nurse even spoke
of the bandboxes containing the winter hats
as if they had recently broken out like a
plague. When every one had displayed their
grievances, I remembered that I wanted
another room myself in which to escape
from them—the aggrieved parties—a
question-proof room if possible with only
one door. I had thought of an underground
suite of apartments like that of the Duke of
Portland, with a glass roof. It would have
been such a pleasure to watch the numerous
legs of my tormentors as they ran about
looking for me. I told the efficient female
that we thought of moving, and she said:
“Ah, I knew you would have to sooner or
later.” I assured her that it was quite undecided,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
and that if we did move it would
be into a smaller house. The odious creature
smiled falsely, and said, of course that was
the ideal life. They themselves never knew
what peace was until they moved into a
small house, and one really well-trained
servant could run everything for eight people
quite easily. That is all very well for her.
She has given up making ices in boots and
omelettes in hats, and now eats nothing but
nuts. She is so vilely efficient that she secured
from her harassed Maker the only sample
he had of a patient husband who can and
will digest anything. She kept the pattern
and made a little outfit of children of the
same convenient kind. Then, I suppose, no
more were stocked, as, on the whole, there is
no great demand for docile nut-eating men.
They do not provide enough incident for
the average household.</p>

<p>When James was thoroughly fired with
the struggling-up idea, he set his mind
towards the topmost pinnacle of ambition.
A house near the Park was not enough for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
him, we must move into the country.
“Where does the country end and the
county begin?” I asked. “The county, I
understand, is the thing to aim at.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he said. “I always
thought it was the whole caboodle, town and
country and all.”</p>

<p>“But, then, where do the county families
come from?” I asked.</p>

<p>“The large provincial towns, I believe,”
James replied without looking up from his
book.</p>

<p>“Can you live right in town and be a
county family?” (Silence.)</p>

<p>“What county families do we know?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the Higginbottams and the Crackers
and the Fitzmullets—do go away.”</p>

<p>“But they all live in the town except the
Fitzmullets, who are seven miles from a
railway station.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t go away at once,” said
James, “I will see that the whole county,
wherever we are, calls on you, and you will
die of a slow, insidious poison. They will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
poison your mind and your dress and your
language. Do you see?”</p>

<p>I left the subject then. We shall come
back to it later, because the struggling up of
a species from one vantage-point to another
is a fascinating study for those who love
Nature, and I have not half got to the
bottom of this county business yet; it is so
involved. In the meantime there was the
move itself.</p>

<p>Of all the experiences most calculated to
humble the mighty a house move is the
most humiliating. One’s household possessions
lose all reticence, decency and moral
sense. They flaunt themselves and cry
aloud to the passers-by for attention. They
behave more like Neapolitan beggars than
anything else—maimed beggars on the spree.
I have seen antics performed by my own
furniture that made me long to burn down
every city of the Empire and be numbered
amongst the beasts of the field. An undertaker’s
work seems wholesome and cheerful
compared to that of the furniture-remover.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
He gets an ingrained sense of squalor that
corrupts his senses and his memory until
ugliness is to him not only inevitable but
appropriate. I met the foreman packer
staggering up our garden path with a wardrobe
on his head. In one hand he flourished
a picture (with the glass broken) representing
the Duke of Wellington standing with
drawn sword on the top of a mountain; in
the other a fire-screen that was once intended
for a jumble sale, but had been mislaid for
years behind the plate-chest.</p>

<p>“For the drawing-room, I suppose,” he
observed, and passed on. I ran after him,
protesting that both were marked “not to
go”; but when I reached the house I found
them in the middle of the drawing-room
floor with seven unspeakable cushions marked
“cook’s bedroom,” a warming-pan (unearthed
from heaven knows where), James’s
large and particularly ugly writing-table, and
the dining-room carpet neatly tacked down.</p>

<p>The efficient female tells me it is the
easiest thing in the world to move. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
just mark everything with the number of
the room where it is to go. But she forgets
that a wombat with its brain amputated
could tell at a glance to which room her
things belong, and she takes everything with
her. There is a place for every horror and
every horror is in its place. The hat-rack,
the dining-room chairs and curtains, the
assorted oddments for the spare bedroom,
and the only comfortable furniture (rather
specially dusty velvet with bob fringe) for
the smoking-room. You cannot even mistake
the pictures, for all those belonging to
the drawing-room are water-colours with
yellow frames, the dining-room has the
“portraits in oils,” those for the bedrooms
are photogravures representing the emotions
(and it does not matter how they are
distributed), historical pictures go in the
passage, the agricultural and sporting in the
smoking-room, and in the bathroom go the
family groups and churches. So the foreman
easily makes a nice job of it. It is a painful
experience to find how easily some one else<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
can fit us with a suit of circumstances which
do not belong to us, just by expecting them
to be ours. They pop a whole environment
to which they are accustomed over our
heads and button it round the neck before
we have time to escape. It took me a whole
week to free myself from a certain Mrs.
Simpson, into whose form I was buttoned by
the foreman packer with his preconceived
notion of what a lady moving house ought
to be like. He had such firm faith in Mrs.
Simpson, and expected so confidently to find
her in my house, that his faith removed the
mountain of my individuality, and I became
his ideal. His mind was so steeped in Mrs.
Simpson, he was so incapable of recognising
the existence of any married woman but
Mrs. Simpson, that he was obliged to fish
Mrs. Simpson out of his pocket and clap her
over my head before he could adjust his mind
to understand what I wanted. When he
first came to see me about the arrangements,
he looked me up and down and metaphorically
said: “Excuse me, I will just fetch Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
Simpson, and then we shall know where we
are.” As he fixed me with his eye, I felt
myself becoming like the lady in an advertisement
for tea. I could feel the chocolate-like
richness of the fluid I should pour out
for my lace-begarbed friends who sat amiably
smiling round the mixed biscuits and the
cruet. I knew that I had on a speckled
blouse with a wired collar, and a short tweed
skirt, and that I looked just thirty-seven, and
was extremely sensible and good-natured.
My own house that I loved so much disappeared
under the petrifying expectation
of that foreman, and at the sight of his notebook
there sprang up dishevelled pink paper
lamp-shades, photograph frames in the form
of banjos and sunflowers, rickety overmantels,
and everything that Mrs. Simpson always
had. All Mrs. Simpson’s past surged into
my veins. I remembered how I had gone
with Mr. Simpson (who was rather a darling
in those days) to buy our furniture, and how
I, sighing after a heavy day amongst the
suites, had said: “I think we have done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
everything now except the ornaments for
the drawing-room mantelpiece.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said dreamily to the foreman,
“everything is to go please—the drawing-room
ornaments—and the overmantel—and
the cosy corner—and the what-not.”</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, m’m,” he interrupted,
“they’ll be in the drawing-room, I suppose.
I don’t see what you’re describing here.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” said I. “It was your friend,
Mrs. Simpson, who put me out for the
moment.”</p>

<p>“I think there must be some slight
mistake, m’m,” he said, “I don’t seem to
remember a Mrs. Simpson.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” I answered, making a great
effort to possess myself again, “of course
there is no such person; I know that. But
now we really must get on.”</p>

<p>“You leave everything to me, mum,”
he assured me, “and we’ll move everything,
just as it is now.”</p>

<p>“But, please,” I begged, “I don’t want
everything moved. You know I said that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
a few minutes ago. There is a lot of
rubbish in the house that is not to go at all.
You will be very careful, won’t you, not to
take what is marked “not to go”?</p>

<p>He promised, with tears of enthusiasm in
his eyes, and he took everything, without
exception. I found an old potato, that Ruth
had left in the sink, sprouting under the
spare room bed a fortnight after we moved
in; it had a large white label round its
neck with “not to go” printed on it. I
was so worked up by this discovery that I
wrote to the foreman about it, and he replied
that he was very sorry; it had been a misunderstanding.
He understood that No. 2
bedroom was the servants’ apartment, it
seemed so bare.</p>

<p>I had really had a good dose of Mrs.
Simpson before the foreman assaulted me
with her. She was a great friend of the
house-agent. He had acted for her for years,
and I had a sickening day in her shape when
we were looking for houses. The first agent
I went to brought her with him to the door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
of a residential mansion he wished to dispose
of. He attired me in her garments while we
were waiting for the caretaker.</p>

<p>“I expect you manage to get your own
way pretty well in the matter of decorations,
don’t you?” he began. “I notice the ladies
generally do.”</p>

<p>I became Mrs. Simpson at once. “Oh
yes,” I said, “my husband is much too busy
to take notice of these things. It wouldn’t
do to trouble the gentlemen with them,
would it?” Then I threw Mrs. Simpson to
the ground and trampled on her.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, I don’t like this house,” I
said quite firmly, but he took no notice and
told me to wait till I had seen round a bit.
That revived her. When Mrs. Simpson is at
her worst I see advertisements in the way I
am told drunken men see spiders. I became
Mrs. Simpson in an advertisement for somebody’s
lemonade. I ran about over a tennis
lawn; young men with Arrow collars and
Viyella shirts lay on the grass beside a picnic
basket; some one else, in a punt, poured out a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
new brand of lime-juice cordial. There was
a high wall round our garden, and up the
wall crept monstrous roses grown under the
influence of pills for plants. My grandfather
was there too in a smoking-cap, rolling the
lawn with a special kind of roller.</p>

<p>“Look here,” I said, “I am so sorry, but
I cannot bear this. I don’t like the shape of
the lady who lived here.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked the agent,
looking at me over some horrid eyeglasses
(I think they were some new patent ones
that boasted of being practically indistinguishable
from the real eye). “It was an
old gentleman that lived here with three
daughters. Who told you there was a
lady?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter,” I persisted. “An
old man with daughters is just as bad—I
mean, I don’t think the house is healthy.
If you will send me your list I will go round
by myself.” I went to three or four other
agents until at last I found one who did not
know Mrs. Simpson, and I took the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
house he offered me. Coleridge, or some one
of that sort, had lived there, but he had been
ousted by some rich Americans who are so
volatile that they do not stick like the Mrs.
Simpsons, so I very soon had the place to myself.
When we go I shall scrape the walls
and remove all the fittings and the tragic little
bits of linoleum and empty bottles. The
deadest mutton is never so dead as objects
that have been called into temporary life by
human ownership. I would rather find
fifteen naked corpses in a house than one old
pair of trousers. I should like to take that
house agent to Pompeii and show him the
petrified bodies and their belongings and ask
him which made his flesh creep most. It
might make him abandon his gruesome trade
and be the end of Mrs. Simpson. But if
there were no houses to let, where would all
the poor ladies of England lay their eggs?
It is not practicable.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV_SHOPPING"><i>CHAPTER XV</i>: SHOPPING
IN LONDON</h2>
</div>


<p>When we moved into our new
house there were many things to
be bought. I spent a happy day
with lists as fat as encyclopædias, but that
seemed such an expensive way to shop that
I finally went to London instead. Lists are
so attractive. Everything looks desirable,
and one remembers so much that one would
otherwise forget that it seems wiser to go to
the shop itself. One gets disillusioned there
in no time before the actual things. It becomes
delightful not to have them in one’s
own house. Above all, one gets so weary
of going “straight through on the left.”
Nothing seems worth while at the cost of
going straight through on the left. I went
straight through on the left for hours at a
time, and at last came to a large window
looking out on to a fire-escape.</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure the poker department<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
is straight through on the left?” I asked
the shopwalker.</p>

<p>“Quite sure, Madam,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Then,” I said, “if you will hold my
parasol and my hat and wait until I take off
my skirt, I will go there. I see it is down
the fire-escape.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. Madam,” he said, “this way,
please.”</p>

<p>It was not anywhere near the left: it was
to the right, and down some stairs, and round
two corners, and past the drapery. I bought
the poker and tongs and then asked for a
shovel. The man directed me to the ironmongery
department.</p>

<p>“No, Madam,” I was told, “this is the
furnishing. Kitchen department is in the
ironmongery.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” I said, “I know it is
straight through on the left, but could you
tell me, do you think, in other words, where
that is?”</p>

<p>“Straight through on the left, Madam.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” I said. “I understand that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
I climb over these wardrobes, cut my way
through the carpets, and proceed straight
through the wall.”</p>

<p>“Past the hosiery, Madam, straight
through on——”</p>

<p>I took the young man’s arm and asked if
he would mind coming with me. “Now,
tell me,” I said confidentially, as we threaded
our way to the right, and up and down the
stairs, round the gallery and home by the
gent.’s outfitting. “Just stop a moment and
try to follow what I am saying. You see
this ribbon counter on my right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Madam.”</p>

<p>“And the silk remnants in front of me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Madam.”</p>

<p>“And the stationery at the back?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Madam.”</p>

<p>“Very well then, how can all these points
of the compass be straight through on the
left?”</p>

<p>“It all depends which way you are standing,
Madam.”</p>

<p>“I see; then when I want anything that is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
on the ground floor and you tell me to go
straight through on the left, the best thing I
can do is to lie down on my left side and try
to remember which way you are facing?”</p>

<p>We were divided here by a stream of
dishevelled women passing in different
directions.</p>

<p>“Ribbons, forward!” said the young man,
and he disappeared—I suppose straight
through on the left.</p>

<p>Shop assistants are so invariably prepared
to give advice on matters of dress and
domestic management that I suppose there
are people who go to shops not to buy but to
have a heart-to-heart talk about what they
shall buy. They must be the same amiable
creatures who conduct their love affairs under
“Aunt Lena’s” superintendence in the penny
magazines. I refuse to believe that the shop
assistant really cares for what purpose I want
a quarter of a yard of green velvet cut on
the cross.</p>

<p>“What is it for?” the girl asks wearily as
she reaches up for the box. “Is it for a hat?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>If you are just silly you tell her, perhaps,
that it is for a pair of boots, in which case
she is as kind as before and replies, “Fancy
dress, I suppose. In that case you had
better bring the dress it is to go with and
I’ll see you get it matched. What is the
name of the character you are going as?
because we have some special brocades for
characters from Shakespeare. You will find
them in the theatrical department, straight
through on the left.” If you are polite and
tell her that in fact you want it for the
collar of your coat that Uncle Sam gave you
at Christmas, because it got spoilt with the
cork of the freckle lotion having come out
in your box, she tells you that it is a pity
to buy velvet at all: there is so little velvet
worn now. The embroidered collars are far
newer and, with your complexion, would be
less trying than the velvet. “You’ve rather
a high colour, haven’t you?” she adds (looking
herself like an anæmic gooseberry).
She probably aims this dart at you on a
sultry day, when you have been apoplectically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
following the straight path on the left for
two hours in search of white cotton and a
tooth-brush.</p>

<p>If I want pale green cotton flecked with ruby
and just a soupçon of chenille mixed with the
thread, I can get it at the first attempt.
Every counter of every shop in the street
will stock it in abundance; but things like
white cotton and tape and safety-pins are not
stocked within the four-mile radius. You
have to spend an hour in the tube, with
frequent changes, before you reach the
suburbs where are the little post office
linendrapers that keep the daily necessaries
of every woman’s existence. “Pins! Oh,
no, Madam, not pins like that we don’t keep.
We have the fancy-headed ones, twelve
inches long, and a very nice two-inch glass
pin at two-three the pair. I fancy you
might get the sort you want out in Bayswater.
I couldn’t name any particular shop just for
the moment, but I fancy you would find some
there. If not, you will get them at some of the
small establishments by the Crystal Palace.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>Another thing which adds to the burden
of a day’s shopping is the difficulty of
describing what you want in the jargon
that will lead you to the right counter.
What properly brought up person knows
whether stockings are “drapery” or “outfitting”?
It all depends on how you want
to wear them, one would suppose. In fact,
I believe they are “hosiery.” And yet,
if I could force myself to say “hosiery” to
the liftman, I should probably find that in
addition to the hosiery being straight through
on the left, and therefore in the next street
but two, it meant gent.’s up-to-date footwear
only, and that ladies’ stockings were in the
haberdashery, second turning on the right
and across the road as you leave Shaftesbury
Avenue. I sometimes wonder whether
there are people who in private life call
their garments by the names used in shops,
and if not, where is the use of annoying
harmless decent people by these words? I
asked James what a “singlet” was and he
said he did not know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>“Well then,” I said, “do you suppose
that the shopman who sold me these vests
for you says to his wife: ‘My dear, why
have you allowed the cat to sleep on my
singlet?’ and if so, does she know what he
means? and how can she bear to live with
him?”</p>

<p>“If she really cared for him,” James
answered, “she would not mind if he called
it an antimacassar. The only thing that
mattered would be that she should remove
the cat and feel heartily ashamed of herself.”</p>

<p>“Do you know, it cost me an hour’s
argument to get those vests for you because
I refused to buy them as singlets and the
man wouldn’t sell them as vests. I won in
the end because he was getting tired and
there were so many people waiting. I think
he saw I was serious. But it wasted a fearful
lot of time. And now, again, what do you
call these?”</p>

<p>“Draws,” said James in one syllable.</p>

<p>“Quite so, that is how I was brought up;
but do you realise that the young lady in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
the shop would not give me anything but
‘knickers’? It made me feel so tweedy,
and golfish, and detestable, that I would not
buy any.”</p>

<p>“Very silly,” he commented. “Besides,
no one plays golf in knickers. It is an impossible
word. It sounds like ready-made
Fauntleroys for young gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Thank you a thousand times,” I said,
“that is just the word I was looking for. I
shall always call them Fauntleroys in future.
And now about skirts.”</p>

<p>“What about skirts?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Do you call a skirt a thing that you put
on over or under?”</p>

<p>“I call the top one a skirt and the under
one a petticoat,” said James, after reflection.</p>

<p>“If you knew anything about haberdashery
or outfitting or singlets, or going
straight through on the left, you wouldn’t
have any petticoats,” I explained. “You
would have a skirt—unless you were dressed
in tricot or gold-beaters’ skin, which, I believe,
is newer—and the thing you wore on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
top would be a ‘robe’ or a ‘blouse suit,’
or a ‘costume’ or a ‘trotteuse’ or a
‘cache-corset’ or—oh dear! I am out of
breath. I can’t disentangle terms any more.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid your shopping has gone to
your head,” said James. “Did you buy anything
useful? Did you remember the library
carpet and the lawn-mower?”</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” I said; “they were straight
through on the left and that brought me out
at Covent Garden, so I bought some peaches
for you, and when I began again it was too
late—the shop was shutting.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said, “I will go to-morrow
myself. It will do just as well and,
I dare say, cost less in extras.”</p>

<p>He came home at seven and would answer
no questions, but shut himself up with
Harrods’ list. When he had written for
what he wanted, I met him in the hall and
opened the door with a polite bow.</p>

<p>“Pillar-box, straight through on the left,”
I said.</p>

COUNTRY HOUSE</h2>
</div>


<p>I have said that we should come back
to the question of county families, for I
find it is a subject that I cannot keep
off. I remember twenty years ago there was
a well-known lady who used to ramp through
the streets of the second or third city of the
Empire dressed in a tailor-made suit like a
riding-habit. On her head was a hard felt
hat shaped like a paper boat and ornamented
with some remains of a grouse. Round her
neck was the dirtiest of white silk handkerchiefs
loosely knotted. In fact, her whole
appearance was arranged to convey the impression
that her relations kept ferrets. In
those days the effect was more marked, as the
county was then a little island of the blest
where no towns except capitals were mentioned.
But it is all different now. No
suburban residence is complete without its
pheasant, and you absolutely must walk so
that we all understand how difficult you find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
it to manage these pavements after the
freedom of Papa’s moors. It is wonderful
what the imagination will do! But these
are not the real provincial county families;
they are a subdivision who live just outside
the town and who make a point of the
“glass” rather than the pheasants.</p>

<p>No, the real county families live farther
afield. Papa could motor in to business if he
liked, but he is a little blasé about motoring
and also economical. The petrol and wear
and tear cost more than the railway journey.
Besides, the train is quicker, and if he is not
used to smuts and smells by this time then
he ought to be! It is no longer in good
taste to conceal the whereabouts of Papa
from the idle rich who are able to luxuriate
all day amongst the sheep and the ox, and
the beagle and the fox, and the bird in the
greenwood tree. So many of the best people
are in business that it does not matter as it
used if we speak about it. The only thing
that can make anyone really impossible is to
know too many people. You may be silly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
malicious, greedy, untruthful, parsimonious
or lewd, but you will be a tremendous county
dog-fox if you will only assert yourself and
be rude enough. But you must be really
rude—no half measures—say really smart
things about your friends that they won’t
like. You will need to take infinite precautions
or the wrong people will want to
know you, so be very very careful, because it
is so dreadfully important that they shouldn’t.
It would put an end to everything.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for any amusement I might
have got out of our new life, James and I
were turned over to the county before we
arrived. Some indiscreet friend had written
to one of the leading authorities on position
and told her who James’s uncle was. That
was enough; try as I would they were never
sincere with me. They sometimes went so
far as to say that the things I did were a
pity, but that was nothing. What I should
have liked would have been to learn their
abracadabras and beat them at their own
game or else to lose and bob up again
somewhere else. To have the victory given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
into one’s hands is no fun. Still, I learned
something by the gasping and choking it
cost the poor things to swallow some of my
friends, and by their unwilling acceptance
of the fact that I did not play games and
could not afford to hunt. They told me I
should find croquet such a resource.</p>

<p>“But I am not resourceful,” I argued
with Mrs. Van Dieman. “It gives me so
much more pleasure to see you run about
and enjoy yourself.”</p>

<p>“You don’t need to run at croquet,” she
protested, “surely you know better than
that, and bridge is a nice quiet game if you
are not fond of exercise.”</p>

<p>“It is not that I don’t like exercise,” I
explained. “I have played leap-frog often
and enjoyed it, and I love riding. Escaping
from people who ask questions is splendid
exercise too; one needs a lot of resource for
that!”</p>

<p>“Well, come to my party next Thursday,”
she said. “You need not play any games;
you can sit on the verandah and eat peaches
and get as fat as you like.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>“Will you promise that your butler won’t
come and tell me that the peaches have
‘never come’?” I asked.</p>

<p>She promised, and, after an hour’s scuffle
hunting for the right gloves and finding that
it was too windy for the hat I wanted to
wear, I arrived at the Van Diemans’. It was
rather late and I had had all the exercise I
wanted coming along the dusty road. There
were about fifteen people there, all running
about after balls of different sizes and textures.
I do not think that I am at heart a perfect
lady, because I always see social festivities
from the point of view of the servants. It
was through the butler’s eyes that I saw his
master and mistress and their guests employing
their leisure: in my mind’s eye I carried
the trays full of nourishment to help them
prolong their activities and get the balls over
nets and through hoops and into holes.
Their ankles appeared to me absurdly thin,
their bodies absurdly fat, their pleasure
absurdly inadequate to the trouble they were
taking. The sprawling creatures who played<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
football on Saturday outside the village were
just as grotesque in appearance, but their
game had a little more of the pleasure of
battle and a little less of kindergarten occupation
than this. In an illustrated catalogue
of parlour games there is one picture which
shows an athletic footman putting away a
jig-saw puzzle in a special cabinet, so designed
that the pieces may remain undisturbed until
the next fit of vacuity takes the fat lady in
the low dress and her beautifully clean-shaven
partner who, according to another picture,
have been spending enraptured hours over a
desiccated post card. There was some of this
fatuousness in the Van Dieman games.</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Mrs. Van Dieman when
I had finished my fourth peach and was
getting really happy and contented, thinking,
indeed, that there was some point after all
in being a bloated aristocrat, “if you won’t
play at anything will you walk round the
garden? You must do something; it isn’t
good for you to sit still so long, and Mrs.
Fortescue hasn’t seen the roses.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” I answered sleepily, “tell the
fourth butler to bring them here and we
will look at them.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” said my determined hostess.
“Get up and take her round; she says she is
getting a chill.”</p>

<p>There was no good in making a fuss, so
I went and we strolled up and down the
narrow path in the baking sun, jogging into
each other in order to avoid treading on the
border of pinks.</p>

<p>“How perfectly wonderful!” Mrs. Fortescue
said from time to time. “Did you ever
see such a monster?” She is a dear old lady
and I did my very best. I said that they
were graceful, wonderful, exquisite, that
they added so much to my interest in the
country that I did not know what I should
do without them. I picked her lace mantle
off the bushes when it got caught, I made
way for her round the corners, and dodged
about, and knocked into her, and trod on
her toes when she first stood aside for me and
then decided to proceed just as I slipped by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
to save trouble. I disentangled her parasol
from my veil eight times and said that it
did not matter a bit, it was torn already; I
admired the gooseberry bushes and the artichokes
and wondered how many gardeners
they needed to keep the herbaceous border so
tidy; I pointed out several particularly rich
colours entirely on my own initiative and
was really brilliant about the thinning out of
something—I forget what—it was just a
fluke anyhow. When we got back and Mrs.
Fortescue kindly offered to drive me home
because she said I looked absolutely worn out
with the heat, I jumped at her suggestion.
But, first, I took Mrs. Van Dieman aside.
“Very well, Minnie,” I said, “I shall send
you a book of fables which I want you to
read carefully. There is one about an elephant
who was ill-treated by his keeper. Years and
years afterwards he met the man at a public
gathering or somewhere, and squirted a pail
of dirty water over him. This will show
you how tenacious a thing is memory. The
second story I want you to notice is of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
a stork who invited a fox to lunch. You
shall lunch with me next Tuesday and I will
ask three Russian anarchists and the clown
from Hengler’s Circus to meet you and you
shall play ‘consequences’ with them.”</p>

<p>“By the time you have been here six
months,” she assured me, “you will have
made far nicer friends; there are some quite
delightful people near here.”</p>

<p>“But if they are all so delightful,” I said,
“why have none of them a good word to say
for one another? At every turn one is brought
up by the word ‘impossible.’ It starts up
like a policeman with a gloved hand.”</p>

<p>“My dear,” she remonstrated, “you
ought not to complain, you seem to do
whatever you like.”</p>

<p>“Then look here,” I persisted, “excuse
me, Mrs. Fortescue is waiting, I must fly—why
cannot the others do as they like—all
your delightful people?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is different,” Mrs. Van Dieman
answered loftily. “They are quite impossible;
it would never do.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII_THE"><i>CHAPTER XVII</i>: THE
BUTLER</h2>
</div>


<p>We had at last struggled up to such
heights above the sorrows of the
Palmerston Road that we were
able to buy a butler. The main reason for
this important social advance was that Clara
had married a traveller in sewing machines
and, like a lady with a pet canary, I could
never, never care for another; a bullfinch
perhaps, but not a canary. With a butler I
should have a new and therefore possibly
interesting set of vices to contend with, but
to bring out again my old quack remedies for
morning blindness and ubiquity would be
beyond my strength. I could not face the
explanations about table-napkins, and “ladies
first,” and unpunctual tea-kettles, nor, above
all, the black cloud of displeasure which
would be sure to billow from under the
pantry door and pervade the house after my
ruthless destruction of lifelong habits. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
good manservant never mentions what he
has been accustomed to. If you differ from
him he puts up with you if he can, and if
not, he says that he finds the air is not so
healthy as that of Herefordshire and, sorry
though he is to leave you, he prefers to make
a change and try gravel soil.</p>

<p>Perrin liked me, I am glad to say. He
thought that I was inexperienced, but shaped
well to become a good mistress if I would be
a little more particular in some things; he
relied on himself to teach me his ways in
time. He told me rather pointedly, within
the first days of our acquaintance, that he had
been obliged to leave his last place because
there was too much freedom. The master
had been on a ranch all his life and come
suddenly into the property and, as was to be
expected, hardly understood his position.
“It was very awkward for me,” he added,
“as you will understand, being obliged to
mention what was expected.”</p>

<p>“And what was expected?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Well, of course, ma’am, it is difficult to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
say exactly, but there were many little things.
His late lordship was always very particular
that at least three of us should sit up for him
when he came home late.” I blushed
nervously as I remembered how James and I
had always let ourselves in with a latch-key
and had eaten our sandwiches and heated
our soup on the gas-ring. It was just possible
this had reached Perrin’s ears through Ruth
and he was deliberately warning me not to
go too far.</p>

<p>“That is what one would expect, of
course,” I said. “Mr. Molyneux gives a great
deal of trouble and is most fanciful and inconsiderate.
You will have to be very careful.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, ma’am,” he answered. (How
soothing that is after the female “yes’m,” I
thought.) “How many shall I bring tea for?”</p>

<p>“Oh, about forty,” I said airily.</p>

<p>“Very good, ma’am. In the woods, I
suppose?” Clara used barely to answer
when I asked for tea on the lawn, and she
always brought it all on one tray, with the
cakes piled on the top of the bread and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
butter and scones; moreover, she staggered
and panted to impress me with its weight,
and held up her dress and suffered for the
rest of the week from sore throat, “owing to
wetting me feet on the grass.”</p>

<p>The woods were at least a quarter of an
hour’s walk from the house and across a ditch.</p>

<p>“Certainly, in the woods,” I said, “and
if by any chance I should be alone for tea
after all, you can come round a longer way.
That will give you almost as much trouble.”</p>

<p>I wondered at first how I should explain
my way of living to Perrin, and whether he
would make me give up much that I held
dear. Would he allow many of what Clara
called the “goings on” of my house? But,
to my surprise, he did not mind at all; in
fact, I understood that he preferred many of
the people whom Mrs. Van Dieman so much
disliked to Mrs. Van Dieman herself. I
could see that he thought most of the stars
of the neighbourhood a poor lot. “His late
lordship never thought much of them he let
his place to each year,” he told me. I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
have liked to hear about these objectionable
tenants, but I saw that Perrin’s gems must
be gathered when and where they fell; he
gave nothing of value for the asking. However,
with patience and care, I learned by
and by some of the reasons why the usurpers
had failed to please. He told me once, in a
fit of irritation, that a young commercial
gentleman from Sheffield, who took his late
lordship’s place one year, seemed to have very
little idea of how things should be. He
seemed, for instance, to think that the place
belonged to him. This seemed to me
rather hard when I remembered how little
James and I heeded the ownership of the
frowsy creature to whom we paid rent for
our delightful house in Palmerston Road. If
it had not been for James’s uncle, I should
not have dared to put forward this view. As
it was, I said timidly: “But, after all, I
suppose they were owners for the time being,
Perrin.” He was not offended, on the
contrary he gave the idea his indulgent consideration,
but it would not do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>“We hardly regard the town builders,
ma’am, as on a par with the families as have
owned the property for generations.”</p>

<p>I probed delicately for more horrible
details.</p>

<p>“He spoke of the Master of the Hounds,
ma’am, as the Captain of the Dogs.”</p>

<p>There was a solemn silence. I could do
nothing but murmur expressions of sympathy
and disgust; but my thoughts took suddenly
a fantastic turn and I mentally christened
our present leader of county society the
“Mistress of the Cats,” hunting impossible
birds to a well-deserved social death. I
awoke from my dream of delight and
waited. “Mr. Huggins” (that was the name
of the commercial gentleman) “went so far
as to request me to bring the gramophone
on to the lawn on Sunday afternoon.
Fortunately, I had disabled my arm at the
time and the doctor considered it inadvisable
for me to attempt weights of any kind, so the
second footman obliged them; otherwise I
should have been in great difficulty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>I still think that Perrin did the poor
things injustice, and that if his late lordship
had ordered a barouche full of gramophones
to be brought on to the lawn, my friend
would have adjusted his prejudices and his
arm to meet the case. His dislike was due
to a primitive suspicion of an alien tribe
whose size and shape and smell offended
him. Just as I feel about Mrs. Simpson—I
am not running her down in any way.</p>

<p>There was an awful moment of anxiety
when it occurred to me that Perrin might
want me to play games, but, on thinking it
over, I decided that he would not wish it
unless I played very well indeed, and that I
knew was an impossibility. I could not face
the idea of tennis while he was bringing out
the tea or announcing visitors. My legs
would be sure to get entangled in his eye
and then all would be over between us.
We were obliged to get a victoria and a pair
of horses soon after he arrived, as he disliked
my coming in tired and dusty from paying
visits. Of course, that meant a footman too,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
as I hate a victoria with one horse, and
nothing would induce me to drive behind
two horses and one man—if there is only one
man to two horses the man’s hat gets fluffy
at once, also it is impossible to make one
man’s coat fit properly; so long as there are
two horses, it is always loose behind the
shoulders and his white collar behaves like
the setting sun. So there we were, involved
in endless expense and all because of Perrin.
But oh! the relief of it! The mere fact
that he did not wear cuffs that came off, and
rattled, and were left about on tables, gave me
much peace of mind, and, best of all, I basked
in the certainty that although he might
direct my actions, he would never interfere
with my thoughts as Clara did. I could
hear her thinking and having feelings all
over the house; but Perrin did all his
thinking in the pantry, never permitting
himself to indulge his brain in my presence.
I knew that when Clara said she “hadn’t an
idea,” it meant that her mind was so seething
with folly that it was likely to burst forth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
into reproach at any moment. When I
asked Perrin where my thimble and scissors
were, he said that he would ascertain, which
meant that he withdrew respectfully to the
pantry and there brought his mind to bear
on all the places where an addle-headed
female was most likely to have left such
things, and then he looked until he found
them. He helped me a great deal in the
training of young George, the footman. I
told George one day that he must not gather
his coat-tails round him and leap from the
box as if it were a burning building.
“Thank you, ma’am,” he replied shyly,
“Mr. Perrin has already mentioned it. I
was not going to do it after to-day.” But
even then it was not quite right, and I had to
appeal for help to Perrin. “George’s descent
from the box is not quite right yet, Perrin,
and I don’t know how to explain. Only, I
am not sure whether he reminds me most of
a chimpanzee or a sailor.”</p>

<p>“Quite so, ma’am. I will see that he
practises from the shelves of the pantry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
cupboard,” said Perrin; and in a week it was
impossible to detect how George reached
the ground. Once, Perrin was ill, and we
all moped like sick canaries. George lost
his head and forgot the coffee spoons, the
silver and glass lost their sparkle and sat
about all anyhow on the table. But behind
the scenes the gloom was lightened, although
the meals were irregular and bad owing to
Ruth preparing soup and jelly for Perrin
which she carried to him herself. The
housemaids stole into the garden for flowers
for the invalid’s room, and, one day, delighted
cackles announced the fact that Mr. Perrin
felt well enough to shave himself, and that
Ruth and Lizzie held the glass while Mr.
George prepared the soap. I sent him books
and papers of a masculine kind, such as I
thought he looked as if he would read. He
sent his duty and found them most enjoyable,
but I believe now that in the kingdom downstairs
where Perrin reigns the habits of the
Court are less Victorian than I supposed, and
the sceptre is garlanded with flowers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII_THE"><i>CHAPTER XVIII</i>: THE
DRESSMAKER</h2>
</div>


<p>I can never think of Miss McGregor
without adding the adjective “bitty”
to her name: Bitty Miss McGregor
or Miss Bitty McGregor. She sat always
in such a snowstorm of bits, that by the end
of the day I felt it must be necessary to dig
her out before she could leave her work.
Praise of Miss McGregor (which was given
freely, for we all love her) was qualified by
comments on her “bittiness,” but even that
was not so bad as the pins. The mouthfuls of
them which she threw out all over the floor!
Nurse reckoned, after reading an article in
the <i>Strand Magazine</i>, that if all the pins that
Miss McGregor disgorged during the day
were collected and fastened together, they
would form a chain as long as the cable
between America and England. She never
ate anything but pieces of cheese, with some
cold strong tea, so I conclude that if claret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
and tannin make ink, as I once read they do,
cheese and tannin, mixed, make pins, that is
if they are eaten by a dressmaker; just as
a cow makes different things out of grass to
what Nebuchadnezzar did. I certainly do
not remember buying pins.</p>

<p>What I did complain of was the “slipping-on.”
She glided into the kitchen when I
was wrestling with the beef, and asked me to
slip on an evening bodice. There are, undoubtedly,
people who can give their minds
to an evening bodice on the top of a large
breakfast and attend to the beef at the same
time. Mrs. Simpson<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> could, I am sure, for
one sees the effect of the beef on her bodices,
which sometimes have such a sensible, dead
look about them.</p>

<p>The bodices do not affect the beef in any
way or lighten its weight, because nothing
makes any difference to beef. It knows just
what and where it intends to be, and no one
can divert it from its purpose.</p>

<p>During my early married life I foolishly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
attempted to keep the beef out of the house
on Sunday, because I detest habit, and that
any food or person should acquire the habit
of coming at one particular time makes its
company less of a pleasure than if it took its
chance and dropped in.</p>

<p>I gave the order that no beef “in any
shape or form” was to come into my house
on Sunday. The butcher repeated my order
in the shop, whereupon the beef turned
purple and indignant.</p>

<p>“What!” it said, puffing and blowing,
“I am not to come? There must be some
mistake. They cannot have Sunday without
me; I am part of the day itself. If I am
not present at the table there will be no
Sabbath, and then where shall we all be?
Here’s a pretty kettle of fish! I insist on
going—stop that mutton—it must not leave
the shop.”</p>

<p>The butcher wrung his hands in protest,
and said he knew he should get into trouble,
but the beef replied: “Not a word, Sir, not
a word.” It bustled out of the shop into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
basket and arrived at my door, where it
insisted on being delivered by the boy. But
Ruth had her orders and was firm.</p>

<p>“Just you go back,” she insisted.</p>

<p>“But what about my wife,” blustered
the beef, “my wife the rhubarb tart? If I
am not to take my place upon the board
neither shall my wife attend; she shall not
be served without me.”</p>

<p>“Just keep quiet, please,” said Ruth.
“We’re not having tart; we’re having
soufflé and mutton cutlets, so now be off
with you.”</p>

<p>There was a frightful scene, but I persevered
for three weeks. Then I went
away for a fortnight, and, while I was gone,
the beef came back and curried favour with
Ruth. He poisoned her mind about the
busy day Monday was, with the washerwoman
and all, and how convenient he was
to eat cold; no mess, no second vegetable,
just salad out of the garden, and so on. I
was powerless against the pair of them; but
now I always cut him with a blunt knife.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
Sometimes I cook him on Saturday night, and
he has to appear cold in the middle of the
day on Sunday, which he dislikes as much
as being tarred and feathered with strange
sauces and trimmings.</p>

<p>But to return to Miss McGregor.</p>

<p>“No,” I said, “I won’t. You can slip it
on the beef if you like, he hates being
garnished, and perhaps it will keep him in his
place. Put a whole mouthful of pins in him
if you like, and then snip him into shreds.”</p>

<p>Miss McGregor took no more notice than
if I had been reciting poetry to myself. “If
you wouldn’t mind just slipping it on now,”
she said, with gentle persistence; “I won’t
keep you a minute—unless you have anything
else you could give me to do. You said something
about altering a skirt.”</p>

<p>The back door bell rang.</p>

<p>“I think it’s Jones’s boy,” said Ruth. “Have
you decided what you will have for dinner?”</p>

<p>“If you please, ma’am,” said Louise,
appearing at the kitchen door, “is there
a parcel to go back to Huggins’s?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>“It will be the buttons for your coat,”
said Miss McGregor, “did you decide——”</p>

<p>I heard my daughter’s voice on the stairs:
“Mother!” she called. “Mother! Miss
Mathers wants to know if it is going to
rain, because, if so, shall I wear my old coat?
She says it isn’t fit to go out in, but it is too
cold for the other, unless you would like me
to put on a woolly, and I haven’t got one, so
shall I——”</p>

<p>I dashed up the kitchen stairs. They got
Miss McGregor out of the flour-bin afterwards,
less damaged than I could have
wished. Anne picked herself up, and decided
to chance the weather as offering the least
risk of the two. Jones’s boy, and Huggins’s
boy, and Ruth, and the beef, and Louise
came to some decision amongst themselves
about the buttons and the curry.</p>

<p>When I came back from a pleasant
morning in the woods, I heard that Miss
McGregor was looking for me to slip on a
bodice, and the efficient female had called.</p>

<p>“Has Mrs. Simpson been?” I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>“I beg pardon, ma’am,” said Perrin,
“who did you say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was nothing,” I replied. “I half
expected a Mrs. Simpson; in fact I thought
I saw her in the drive. She would have
attended to Miss McGregor at once.”</p>

<p>The efficient female said I looked tired,
and was anything the matter?</p>

<p>“No,” I said, “nothing particular; but
do you always slip on things when you are
asked—that is, when there is a dressmaker in
the house?”</p>

<p>“Oh, never,” she assured me. “I have a
stand made to exactly my own shape, and
they never need to trouble me at all.”</p>

<p>“But can you judge how a thing will
look with a great red twill bust and a stump
sticking out of it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, perfectly; it only needs a little
imagination.”</p>

<p>When she had gone, I went to Miss
McGregor. “Look here,” I said, “you
slip the things on the housemaid and pretend
she is me. It only needs a little imagination.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>Miss McGregor was sitting in a shower
of bits. She took no notice of my suggestion.</p>

<p>“I have got on as best I could,” she said,
dispersing her last mouthful of pins all over
her tiny chest. I was feeling a good deal
better, and said I would slip on the garment.
The picture she was to copy showed a slim
and graceful creature with a long piece
of soft material wound simply under one
shoulder and over the other, caught in at
the waist with a buckle, and falling in folds
across the side of a very clinging underskirt.
What I saw in the glass was a rain-water
tub (surmounted by my head) covered
with a closely gathered frill which was
neatly sewn along the edge of the lid. The
lid itself had some folds of the material
arranged with geometrical precision round
the place where the head came out.</p>

<p>My breath forsook me.</p>

<p>“Dear Miss McGregor,” I murmured,
“you have not snipped all the stuff into
small bits, have you? If you look at the
picture you will see it is made all in one.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
Just folded round quite simply, beginning
from one corner—so——”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t quite understand how you
would get it on and off the other way,
Mrs. Molyneux,” she said, after a minute’s
thoughtful silence, “and the effect is just
the same. I have arranged the folds so that
they hide the join.”</p>

<p>I stood entranced by my reflection; I
even began to take a morbid interest in it,
as I saw how we depend for our personal
attraction on clothes; it opened such a
world of speculation amongst my friends.
The knowledge was comforting to this extent:
that there is more hope in a petition to
one’s dressmaker to take back the dress she
gave and change it than there would be
in a request to one’s parents for a different
face.</p>

<p>With as little show of alteration as I
could manage, I unripped the gathers, and
taking a corner of the stuff I wrapped it
round my form in the way I wanted, and
stuck in a hat-pin to secure the last bit.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
“There,” I said triumphantly, “that is the
way I want it to go.”</p>

<p>Miss McGregor observed me with patient
scepticism.</p>

<p>“I don’t quite see how I am to arrange
that,” she remarked.</p>

<p>“You must not arrange it on any account,”
I said. “It is to stay just like that.”</p>

<p>“But how are you going to get out of
it?”</p>

<p>“Like this,” I replied, slipping the whole
thing off my shoulders like a skin. “How
I get back again next time is your concern;
you are a dressmaker. Dresses like these
are worn every day in Paris.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t understand how they do
it,” replied the forbearing creature.</p>

<p>“You remind me,” I told her, “of a
plumber we had here last spring. Mr.
Molyneux gave him an order, and the
man asked how he was to do it. ‘I don’t
know,’ Mr. Molyneux said, ‘I am not a
plumber.’ The silly man replied: ‘Well, I
am a plumber and I don’t know.’ Now please<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
don’t be like the plumber; we had quite
enough of that sort of thing with him.”</p>

<p>Miss McGregor poised herself upon one
leg, cocked her head on one side, and said it
wasn’t the way of the stuff.</p>

<p>I know her ways by this time, so I said I
was going out to tea.</p>

<p>It was certain that nothing would induce
her to spend an idle afternoon, and she would
therefore be driven to exercise her brain on
the problem. I threatened her with every
sort of violent and painful death, including
a famine of pins, if she altered a single
fold, and when I came home in the evening
the dress was skilfully arranged. Miss
McGregor is quite sure that if I would slip
the things on fourteen times a day between
meals she would understand better what I
wanted, but I know for a fact she is wrong.</p>

<p>An industrious clerk might as well say to
a poet: “If you tell me what you want to
say in your poem I will write it for you
and you can run your eye over it every ten
minutes to see if it is right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>James says that, so far as he can understand
my criticism of Miss McGregor, that is just
about what I expect her to do, otherwise
why can’t I make the dress myself like the
poet makes his poem.</p>

<p>But it is well known that only unreasonable
people achieve miracles.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX_THE_LADYS"><i>CHAPTER XIX</i>: THE LADY’S
MAID</h2>
</div>


<p>Louise was a treasure: more than
that, she <i>is</i> a treasure, for I have her
still, and love her the more since
it became a certainty that she would not
marry Perrin. I forget whose fault it was
that I got a maid for myself. Probably
Perrin was at the bottom of it; in fact, now
I come to think of it, I remember that I
began to find it increasingly difficult to get
the upper housemaid to fold up my clothes
after I had dressed for dinner. That undoubtedly
was owing to Perrin’s influence.
Before he came there was always plenty of
amusement for the housemaid in my room.
She added finishing-touches to her hair in
front of my big looking-glass, she experimented
with the pots and pans on the toilet
table, she tried on my hats—I came unexpectedly
into my room one day and noticed
that she was putting away three hats which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
I had not worn for a week. I remarked how
annoying it was the way hats would hop
about a room, and apologised for the trouble
they were giving her. She covered me with
moral dust and ashes by the pleasant smile
with which she answered, as she straightened
her hair, that it was no trouble, she enjoyed
handling pretty things, so I was obliged to
give her one of the hats to show my repentance.
After that I vowed that never
again would I trifle with sacred feminine
instincts. She was so pretty I am not surprised
that Perrin sent for her in the evenings
to talk to him while he made George wash
up, but it was very inconvenient for me. I
nearly asked him to let me have her for half
an hour, and I would tell the under housemaid
to turn down the beds a little earlier,
so that she could sit with him until Lizzie
was ready, and then I thought that perhaps
he might not like it, and I had better engage
a maid of my own. Besides, a maid would
save having that bitty dressmaker in the
house; so Louise came. Why Perrin never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
took to her I did not at first understand,
though I accepted the fact with secret gratitude.
Louise is rather a horsy person and,
I think, preferred walks with the coachman
to sitting in a stuffy room, even with Perrin’s
wit to lighten the atmosphere. Like all
horsy people she has a quick, kindly nature,
and none of that touchy indigestion that
spoils so many indoor servants. She is an
excellent dressmaker. The only times when
I am not well dressed are on the days preceding
any race-meeting of importance;
then she loses her head and behaves like a
feverish bird about to lay a nest-egg.</p>

<p>“Mr. Jenkins’s Hardup seems to be a
likely winner for to-morrow, ma’am,” she
says excitedly, brushing my hair with such
energy that I feel I ought to stand up and
straighten my legs while she gets up a good
gloss.</p>

<p>“How much have you got on him,
Louise?” I ask, setting my teeth.</p>

<p>“Well, ma’am, from what Mr. Pierce tells
me of the way he is shaping, according to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
to-day’s paper, I think I shall have a bit
both ways; not very much, of course; half
a crown, I dare say.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t pick the winner for me last
Newmarket as I told you. There, I am sure
that will do beautifully,” I say, trying to
escape before her state of mind leads her
to throw a blanket over my hind quarters.
Some day she will do it, and I shall find it
difficult to hit exactly the right note in what
I say. On the actual day of the race I can
get nothing done, from the time when she
brings my tea in the morning and forgets
the hot water until the evening when she
sends me, by the altogether disapproving
Perrin, a paper (with the day’s results
marked in a trembling hand) which she and
Pierce have walked three miles to buy. She
begs to be excused, of course, and would I
care to glance at the news.</p>

<p>That is one side of Louise’s character.
The other side is very feminine: loves clothes,
and scent, and money, and love-making. She
will never make what is called a good servant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
because I cannot teach her not to enjoy her
life, and I am bound to say I have not tried.
There is only one serious flaw in her so far
as I am concerned, and that is her passion
for dogs. She began by throwing out hints
that I should keep a dog and, when these
failed to take effect, she frankly besought me
to keep one. I said: “Louise, I have your
master and the two children. That is quite
as much as I care to undertake.”</p>

<p>“Lord love you, ma’am,” she replied,
“poor little darlings! you could keep both,
and I would look after him, indeed I would.”</p>

<p>“You can keep an entire pack if you
like,” I said, “so long as you chain them to
your bed, and don’t let them dribble and roll
over me.” The poor thing was in ecstasies,
and I learned that Mr. Pierce knew of a
splendid bull pup that was wanting a home.</p>

<p>“Remember,” I cautioned her, “if he goes
within a mile of the sewing-room he leaves
the world, or at any rate this house, within
the hour.” She promised faithfully and, I
believe, spent a sleepless night planning how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
he should whittle away his noisy and disorderly
days. She asked me to suggest a
name for him, and I said that it would be a
certain comfort and distraction to me if she
called him Rose, but she would not have
that, because, in the first place, Rose was a
lady’s name, and he was nothing if not a real
gentleman, and the smell would soon wear
off—she had not noticed it, in fact. I then
suggested “Gobble,” “Slop,” “Skid” (because
I hated the way he slithered and skated
on the polished floors), “Nebuchadnezzar”
(because his nails were so long and dirty, and
he was always choking over bits of grass),
“Keating” (because he appeared to be
troubled with them), but she rejected all
these and called him Sam, because there was
something in his bloodshot eyes that reminded
her of a favourite cousin who had
died.</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” I agreed, “let us
hope there is something in a name after all.
Did your cousin die of eating too much
Limerick lace?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, no, ma’am,” she said proudly, “he
died of whooping-cough.” (I have often
thought that may be the matter with Sam,
was my private reflection.) “And as for the
lace, I do hope, ma’am, you will overlook
that; it was quite a mistake of the poor
boy’s. He was after a rabbit just when I
happened to have my work outside, and he
was so excited he never stopped to think.”</p>

<p>“Well, he will have all eternity to study
Natural History in next time he does it,” I
remarked, and we changed the subject. I got
to tolerate Sam after a time, because he
finished up James’s cigar ends. An ash-tray
full of horrors vanished in a moment before
his all-embracing slobber—but enough—the
dinner-gong will sound in vain for me if I
allow my mind to dwell on Sam’s habits.
The only dog I have ever loved is dear to
me because he is less like a dog than anything
else. He is known to his friends as
the “occasional table,” because that is what
he is like. He has a highly polished oblong
surface, and stands on Chippendale legs, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
people trip over him, which always amuses
me. There is no high-class amusement like
this to be got out of Sam; he merely barges
into people like a drunken hippopotamus,
which is not in the least funny. But the
“occasional table” is the only dog I know
who appears to possess a pocket-handkerchief
and use it, and I have never seen him eat in
public. Dearest quality of all, he knows
that burglars are not announced in the
drawing-room, even that they do not ring
the front door bell. What a truly blessed
thing life would be if he could spread these
glad tidings amongst the rest of his shrieking
brotherhood! This seems to be a chapter
on race-meetings and dogs rather than on
Louise, my maid; but there is very little
Louise apart from horses, dogs, good temper
and lace, and all these points have been
touched upon. I now understand better
why Perrin does not like her. As one of
the young ladies she would have done well
enough; he would have tucked her up in her
high dog-cart with a certain admiration, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
been pleased with her successes at the Agricultural
and Kennel Club shows. But for
his own after-dinner conversation he prefers
something of a fluffier and less independent
nature; something of the tea-making, “Lord,
Mr. Perrin, be off with you!” sort.</p>

<p>Louise has excellent taste in clothes. She
steers through yards of drapery with the
delicate assurance of a surgeon finding his
way amongst the cobweb creations of the
human body, and she does it all in the same
impersonal way. The Claras of this world
suggest lumps of animated matter rolling
about, spluttering, and disturbing things that
would do very well as they are; the Louises
seem to be furthering the end of some pleasant
universal desire and disentangling the prejudices
that cumber its path.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX_RELATIONS-IN-LAW"><i>CHAPTER XX</i>: RELATIONS-IN-LAW</h2>
</div>


<p>Since I have had a son and daughter-in-law,
I have begun to think that it
is absurd to reflect on the nature of
this or that class of individual, because
members of the same class are of opposite
sexes. I often thought I had found a theory
about such and such a class of people, such as
servants, cousins, relations-in-law, &amp;c., until
one day, when I was being quite truthful
with myself, I understood that a great many
of my theories were reversible according to
sex. This was most strikingly apparent with
regard to my children-in-law. I decided that
it is very objectionable for strange people to
marry into a family and then idealise the
being they have married, without reference
to the lifelong knowledge of that being’s
character possessed by the other members of
the family. It seemed to me that my son-in-law
made himself ridiculous about Anne;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
he really sickened me sometimes. He said
that she was so delicate and sensitive he was
sometimes afraid of crushing her with his
blundering, thoughtless criticisms when she
appeared to differ from him. That was
nonsense, and I told him to go ahead fearlessly,
and say what he thought; even if she was my
own daughter, I was not blind to her faults.
Therefore, logically, according to this theory,
my daughter-in-law, Constance, would be not
only wise in pointing out his faults to Tom,
but she would be neglecting a duty were she
not to speak out. Then I saw the reversible
nature of my feeling. To be blinded by love
is undoubtedly a fault, but in the case of
married people both are not equally to blame.
As in this diagram, taking A as the mother-in-law,
those with a cross representing
children of the male sex. The children-in-law
are D and E.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_215" style="width: 40em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_215.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>Criticism that is right in my child-in-law
D (male) is reprehensible and altogether out
of the question in my other child-in-law E
(female). The blame for idiotic partiality is
transferred from my child-in-law D to C
(one of the family). In fact, to put it still
more simply, I don’t mind my son-in-law
criticising my daughter up to a certain point,
but if my daughter-in-law begins to criticise
my son, I shall probably wring her neck.
Constance has no idea how sensitive Tom
is, and the way he idealises her is ridiculous.
He told me how impossible it was to get her
to spare herself at all, she was always thinking
of others. Just what Robert said about
Anne, but I had different methods of dealing
with them. “Stuff and nonsense,” I said to
my son-in-law, “Anne is not so delicate as
you think, she won’t mind what you say in
the least; it is not shrinking that makes her
silent, it is because she has not made up her
mind what she intends to do. If you do not
want to go to the South of France while your
partner is ill, don’t go. Anne travelled about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
alone for three years before you knew her.” I
did not mind if he thought me a heartless pig;
he was not mine to lose, and Anne, of course,
belonged to herself as she always had. But
Tom was mine and Constance’s, and the only
way in which I could keep my share in him
was to make her also mine. We could not
pull him in two, and she would pull strongest,
so I must change my metaphor and regard
her as a growth upon Tom. I could not
operate on her, so she must just come with
him. Therefore, when he made the same
remark about her as Robert made about Anne,
I assured him that all really good women
worked too hard, and that I had been thinking
perhaps a little motor would save her
running about so much; would she like
one as a Christmas present? Of course,
Constance felt that Tom could be safely
trusted for week-ends with such a parent.
Besides, I never asked him questions about
her (to be truthful I wasn’t interested), and
I always sent back fowls, and asparagus,
and hats, and other useful articles, according<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
to the length of time she let me have
him.</p>

<p>I know that Robert would have liked me to
show a little more nice feeling about Anne;
indeed, once, I was obliged to be quite frank
about it. “Anne and I understand each
other very well,” I told him, “and you
cannot have everything. If I showed nice
feeling she would not like it, and although
you would be the gainer by her annoyance——”</p>

<p>“I don’t see that,” he interrupted. “How
could I be the gainer by Anne’s annoyance?”</p>

<p>“Because you would be the dearer by
contrast. You would say, ‘Never mind,
darling, you have me.’ But please let me
go on. I was going to dwell on your
mercies which you do not seem to be counting.
Suppose, now, that I sat about in your
drawing-room with fancy-work and asked
how you were going to manage about the
spring cleaning. That would mean telling
you at great length how I always did it and
how excellent my dear husband thought the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
arrangement. I should add that, of course,
it was for you and Anne to decide.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose it would be, wouldn’t
it?” he asked foolishly.</p>

<p>“Not if I said it was for you to decide.
That would mean that unless you allowed
me to arrange it in my own way I should
say that no doubt you were right; everything
was so altered since my day that I could not
attempt to judge. And then I should be ill
for a fortnight in your house and have all
my meals carried upstairs, and the servants
would give notice.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” remarked Robert.</p>

<p>“Exactly, then do not complain about my
not showing nice feeling, because I don’t
make myself a nuisance to Anne.”</p>

<p>Another day I told him just to look, for
instance, at Constance’s mother. He said
he thought she seemed a very nice old lady.
“All right,” I said, “Tom is outside, and
he is likely to be open with us to-day, because
his mother-in-law is staying for the
week-end with Constance—come along.” I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
dragged him out under the trees where Tom
was lying in a hammock, reading. When
we had got chairs and explained that we
had ordered tea outside to save him the
trouble of coming in, I said: “I suppose you
can’t stay to dinner if Constance’s mother is
with you?”</p>

<p>“Poor girl!” said Tom, “I suppose I
had better go and give her a hand.”</p>

<p>“But she is a very nice old lady, isn’t she?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, very,” he agreed flabbily. Then he
saw my face, and noticed also Robert’s
intelligent, inquiring expression. “What’s
the matter with you two?” he asked.</p>

<p>“The fact is, darling,” I explained, “that
Robert was a little dissatisfied with me because
he thinks I do not take enough part in his
household arrangements, so we came out, less
to save you the trouble of coming to tea
than that you should save me the trouble of
explaining to him.”</p>

<p>Tom flung down his book. “I will tell
you all about it from beginning to end,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
promised us. “People talk about the mind
being a storehouse, but hers is the bottomless
pit. And the only things that will go into
it are details; if you give her the sort of
things that are in most people’s minds they
lie about outside the pit and make her uncomfortable.
But I get so done up filling
her with the stuff, and so does Con. She
wants to know every detail of our lives, from
the kind of shaving soap I use to whether I
put the lights out myself or leave it to the
servants. Constance has to tell all hers
too. The old lady starves if she doesn’t get
it, and no amount of it seems to satisfy her.”</p>

<p>“But, surely, she must know your day
pretty well by now,” suggested Robert,
taking my hand affectionately.</p>

<p>“You would think so,” said Tom, “but
you see you are wrong, because there is just a
shade of difference sometimes in what I do
every day. For instance, when I go home
to-night I shall have to tell her where we all
sat this afternoon, and when you came out,
and why.” (He tore his hair.) “And what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
the devil shall I say when she asks what we
talked about? I get so giddy with it, you
know, that I just keep the scene in my mind
and give it her all faithfully. I dare not
invent or I should contradict myself.”</p>

<p>Robert apologised to me, and, of course,
I said it was nothing; there was no pleasure
like setting matters of opinion right. But I
returned to Tom for confirmation of my
theories of sex.</p>

<p>“What about your father-in-law? He
asks a good many questions, too, so far as I
remember.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s nothing,” said Tom, “his
are quite harmless questions. I like telling
him what he wants to know; it is generally
quite interesting, about my job and things of
that sort.”</p>

<p>I turned to Robert and asked: “You
never thought my husband wanting in nice
feeling towards Anne did you?”</p>

<p>“Oh dear, no,” he said, “of course not.
One doesn’t expect a man to take much
interest in a house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>There are two great rocks on which
relationships by marriage often split. The
first, which is also the chief source of danger
to blood-relationships, is the presumption
that because we are relations we must love
one another; the second is the presumption
that because we are relations-in-law we must
loathe one another. The only safe line is to
avoid any mention of the connection, even
to oneself. If, in spite of this absence of
prejudice, there is still great natural antipathy,
it is possible to think of ourselves as fellow-guests
at a boarding-house, obliged to meet
pretty constantly at the same table. For the
sake of the mistress of the house, who so
rashly brought us together, we may as well
try to find some redeeming interest in each
other’s vices. I never suggested to Constance
that we should learn to love one another. It
was impossible for me to love anyone because
she was Tom’s wife, I could only loathe her
for it; so I shut my eyes tight and said
the alphabet backwards to myself when the
idea of our relationship came into my head.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
Instead, I thought—or tried to: “This is a
person whom Tom has brought with him
to the house. I expect she will stay a long
time. She must enjoy her visit, and it is
horrid to stay in a house where one is entertained.
She shall have the best we can give
her; we will try not to be rude or dull, and
she shall do as she likes.” When she returned
my hospitality, I tried to be a good guest and
not leave my umbrella and sponge behind me
when I went away, and I always remembered
her birthday. So we got on all right. I
behaved to Robert in the same way. If I
allowed myself a little more freedom in
advising him about his colds, and so on, that
is because any man staying in the house likes
to be given ammoniated quinine when he
needs it. But I never kissed him unless I
wanted to, nor allowed myself to dwell on
the involuntary tie between us.</p>

</div>


<p>When Mrs. Van Dieman was
describing the neighbourhood to
me she mentioned, among other
people, a Mr. Figgins who wrote books. She
said that she would like to get to know him
better, but she did not think he liked her, as
she was not clever enough.</p>

<p>“He probably thinks you do not like him
because he is not rich enough,” I said.</p>

<p>“Oh, but what utter nonsense,” she protested.
“When a man has an intellect like
that he can’t suppose one considers his
money.”</p>

<p>“There you are,” I replied, “that is
exactly what I have been saying. He
probably says to himself, ‘When a woman has
a purse like that she can’t suppose one considers
her brains.’ He must dislike you on
other grounds if he does at all; perhaps it is
your politics, or the fact that your house
faces north.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>“You see, he is so interesting,” pursued
Mrs. Van Dieman. “I should love to know
him better, but I don’t know what to talk
about, I read so little.”</p>

<p>“So does Mr. Figgins, probably,” I said.
“But, anyhow, if you are interested in him,
talk about that; he will like it far better
than anything else—unless you talk about
yourself. If you were as candid with him
as you are with me, he would think about
nothing else for weeks, you would open his
eyes such a lot.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” I began again presently,
“when you meet your baker out at dinner
do you read up ‘Bread’ in the ‘Encyclopædia
Britannica’ first?”</p>

<p>“We certainly do seem to get on the
subject of bread whenever we meet,” she
said. “Perhaps that is why I am not interested
in him.”</p>

<p>“According to you, the baker’s friends,
when they ask him to their houses, would
think it complimentary to powder their hair,
and embroider their dresses with currants.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
As for your Mr. Figgins, how could the
poor man write books if there were nothing
but books to write about?”</p>

<p>By and by, when Mrs. Van Dieman had
plucked up courage and invited most of us
to an embarrassing tea-party to meet the man
of letters, I found that Mrs. Figgins was a
friend of my childhood, and we took up our
relation to one another just where we had
left it. It matured rapidly, and I became
very fond of both of them. Their house
was often full of people whom Mrs. Van
Dieman classified according to the nature of
their public life. This habit of classification,
which is the county method of making a
social order out of the chaos of individual
taste, is very infectious. I began to look at
geniuses as a class, and to think I noticed
certain stripes and spots in their characters
which marked them as belonging to one
family, however much they differed in other
ways. I presented an ode on the subject to
the Figginses, and watched them as they read
it in turn:</p>

<p>Mrs. Figgins was delighted. “There,
Harry,” she exclaimed, “she’s absolutely
right, she has seen you through and through;
I’ve always told you you were the most
selfish beast on earth. It doesn’t matter
what happens to me or the children so long
as you get your wretched stuff out of your
head on to paper. And that about the reading
aloud is so good—and the dusting—and
yet you complain the house is dirty! Oh
dear.”</p>

<p>Mr. Figgins rose, picked his wife out of
her comfortable chair, and transferred her to
his own, which he said was more her size,
then he sat down and read the ode again.</p>

<p>“My dear Jane,” he said, “I have looked
this over very carefully, and you are absolutely
wrong; it is you she means. Look at that
about the children being all over the house,
and a beastly housemaid pottering about his
study, and no money in the house. He even
has to order his own dinner or she gives him
indigestible stuff he can’t work on. He
does his best to amuse and entertain her, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
then she bursts into tears and says she wants
to live; it seems to me to be an admirable
picture of the sort of thing I go through,
only you haven’t the wit to see it.”</p>

<p>I took a stroll round the garden for a
quarter of an hour and when I came back
they were still disputing.</p>

<p>“Do I or do I not have to sit on the
mat for hours at a time listening to you
talking? And if so, how can I be ordering
dinner at the same time?”</p>

<p>“You could order it the night before and
tell them that, whatever happens, I must
have it at a certain time.”</p>

<p>“The certain time being anything between
ten in the morning and three in the
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Malloray’s wife gets her husband the
most excellent food all ready in five minutes,
at any moment he may happen to come in.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Malloray gets paid for his dreary
stuff and you don’t, so he can afford to have
sixteen parlourmaids all sitting about with
nothing else to do. And that about your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
living for two is so good. What life do I
have sitting round when you are there, and
then working like a galley-slave when you
are not to make up for the lost time and
clear up the mess?”</p>

<p>“No man except a farm labourer ought
to marry,” I heard Mr. Figgins say as I
went off again. “What I want is a dear old
toothless, very efficient housekeeper, and
a mistress exquisitely beautiful, talented,
sympathetic——”</p>

<p>We had a great discussion that night at
dinner. Several geniuses and their wives
were there, and civil war broke out. The
geniuses’ complaints were trivial, but apparently
rankled deeply. They all said nearly
the same thing: that their wives wanted too
much, and prevented them from getting on
with their work, to which the wives retorted
that they also wanted to get on with their
work, but it was not possible, because they
were always being called off to listen to
something, or to pack bags, or remove a
spider from the ceiling. Then if they stayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
for a few minutes’ chat, they were accused of
being in the way, and why wasn’t lunch
ready? and why couldn’t they see that the
doors didn’t bang upstairs? If they asked
for love they were given a manuscript as
indigestible as a stone, but, on the other
hand, when inspiration had run out and love
was required (they being busy at the time
doing something else) they were told that
women were practical animals and had no
ideals; that polygamy was the only feasible
arrangement in domestic life, and would
they kindly put on more coal, and make that
cheque last for six months. The geniuses
maintained that we all live much too
elaborately. A simple, well-cooked fowl,
done to a turn at any minute of the day, was
quite enough for anyone; a perfectly proportioned
room ascetically bare, save for a
few necessary objects of priceless value, was
enough to content them. A village girl
with a graceful figure and sun-kissed complexion
should maintain the room in that
spotless order which is essential to a quiet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
mind. The wife should direct everything,
do nothing, be always occupied, always at
hand and scarcely ever present. The children
should have perfect freedom, intelligence,
health, education, no lessons, be full of
gaiety and make no noise, be one with their
parents at heart, never present (like the wife)
for more than a few minutes at a time,
occupied in useful and beautiful handicrafts,
and make no litter about the house. This
is what I gathered from notes made at
the time. From what I understand of the
allegations brought against geniuses by their
wives, there was less detailed complaint and
more profound disappointment. To begin
with, the work did not pay; the world did not
appreciate it, or if it did, it appreciated the
wrong bits—the ones that George himself
cared least about. Secondly, they worked
too hard, and then got so dreadfully depressed;
they never seemed able to throw
down their work and come out for a little bit
of fun in the middle of a sentence. And when
something really serious, like the bailiffs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
happened, one could not get them to attend.
Mrs. Malloray told us that her husband got
so interested in talking to the men about
Australia that he never noticed until they
had gone that all the wrong things had been
taken to pay the debt; instead of getting
rid of a lot of rubbish, as they had hoped,
some of the nicest bits of furniture in the
house had gone, although she kept telling
him all the time.</p>

<p>We all agreed that a genius should not take
his wife about with him. She is there to
fulfil ends which are of no interest to society,
and if she is the right wife for him she will
be as unsocial as a lake by moonlight. If
she is the wrong kind she will make him
fidgety and spoil the party, so she should
amuse herself in other circles, except in
houses where she can bring her knitting
without exciting compassion. I am told
that the Figginses still fight over the spirit of
that harmless piece of doggerel, and both find
it healing to their wounds. It is nice to
think of, isn’t it?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII_CHARITY"><i>CHAPTER XXII</i>: CHARITY</h2>
</div>


<p>A few years after she left the
cradle, Anne came to the decision
that, whatever else she did, she
would not be charitable. I found that this
meant, more explicitly, that she would not
wear a bonnet, nor gloves that were too long
in the fingers.</p>

<p>I wonder what it feels like to be one of the
poor, and realise that one’s only callers are
sure to be people who wear gloves that are
too long in the fingers. I am never at home
to that kind of visitor myself, but for those
who have to answer the door in person there
can be no escape. Also, how distressing it
must be when the visitor sits down and
remarks how clever we have been to make
this poky room so nice, and are those our
husband’s socks? How many does he get
through in the week? I tried it on Mrs.
Van Dieman one day, because I know she
has a district. My entrance was rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
spoilt by the butler being obliged to show me
in, but after he had shut the door I tripped
up to Mrs. Van Dieman with my most sympathetic
smile and said: “What a sweet outlook
you have. It must be such a comfort in
your sordid life to be able to grow flowers.”
I explained that I was district-visiting, and
she happened to be first on my list to-day.
“I hope your poor husband has been keeping
less intoxicated lately?” I added.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” she said
coldly.</p>

<p>“Well, well, we must take the good with
the bad, I suppose, and be thankful if he
has his health,” I said, shaking my head
gloomily, “but you must tell him from me
that I hope that he is going to try to keep
straight now. And you, dear Mrs. Van
Dieman, must try to be less extravagant;
they tell me you spend a great deal on dress,
you know. I am sure you gave as much
for that little thing you have on as I am able
to spend in the whole year on my clothes—though
it is very pretty, of course.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Van Dieman did not seem to understand
about my district, and when I explained
again she said it was quite different with
that sort of people; they had no one to
advise them, and it made a break in the day
having some one to take an interest. All the
same, I thought I would persevere. There
ought not to be one law for the rich and
another for the poor, so I said I would
continue my visits, and hoped to find her
in a better frame of mind next time I
called.</p>

<p>I then went to the rector’s house and
was shown into his study. He was busy
doing accounts.</p>

<p>“Ah, good morning, rector,” I said, “glad
to see you at work. I just called round to
have a chat with you. Now tell me, do
you find yourself well and satisfactorily
shepherded here?”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, I think there must be some
mistake,” said my dear Mr. Tracy.</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” I said, “no mistake. I
only wanted to be a help, if possible. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
are in my district, you know, and it is my
duty to find out if your spiritual welfare
is being attended to. I should be sorry if
you suffered from neglect of anything I
could do to help or advise.”</p>

<p>“It is very good of you, Mrs. Molyneux,”
he replied, though he seemed rather embarrassed.
“Of course, I am only too
grateful for any assistance, but, indeed, I
hardly understand——”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” I said, “let us sit down and
talk it over. Do you find you get enough
mental stimulus in the town?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that there is a lack of
culture?” he asked. “Because if so you have
put your finger on the weakest point in our
society. I find an extraordinary lack of enthusiasm
for anything really great in literature or
painting or music. It is quite deplorable; it
has evidently struck you——”</p>

<p>“It has, indeed.” (This was the most
successful visit I had paid.) “I should be so
glad if there were anything in that direction
that I could throw light upon for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>“I didn’t know that you were an authority
on these things, Mrs. Molyneux,” he said,
greatly impressed.</p>

<p>“I am not,” I answered. “I don’t know
anything about any of them, but you are in
my district, so I was bound to come and take
an interest in you, wasn’t I?”</p>

<p>The dear thing was so nice about it,
and talked so charmingly about the Pre-Raphaelites,
and the <i>Saturday Review</i>, and
the ungracefulness of crinolines, that I felt
there was no room in him for improvement,
so I would go to some more deserving
case. I called next upon Mr. Figgins who
writes books. I found him writing in his
study.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Figgins, hard at work
as usual,” I began.</p>

<p>He was very nice to me, and pretended he
was not at all busy, so I sat down on the
edge of my chair, and looked about.</p>

<p>“This is my day for the district,” I said,
“and I knew I should find you at home just
now. I suppose you are beginning to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
plenty of money with your books? I hope
you are putting some of it by.”</p>

<p>Mr. Figgins looked at me rather curiously,
and said he would order tea.</p>

<p>“No, no, by and by, Figgins,” I said,
stopping him on his way to the bell; “by
and by, when we have had our little chat.
You know money is a great responsibility,
and I sometimes think that you do not quite
realise this with regard to your dear wife;
you know, when the husband makes money
just in order to gamble it away it
means that he and his self-respect are rapidly
going down the hill together. It is quite
time you began to think about your old age,
and what would happen to the boys if the
bread-winner were called away.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would tell me what it is,” said
Mr. Figgins. “If you are rehearsing a play I
will help you, but I must have the book and
know all about it—you can’t go on like this.”</p>

<p>“But I have told you,” I insisted. “I am
district-visiting and you are in my parish, so
I have to take you on a certain day and you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
have to sit and listen to me. I am going to
poke all round your room presently and
leave some literature.”</p>

<p>That really angered him, and he became
dreadfully polite. At last we compromised,
he agreeing to take me home in his motor if I
would stop and have tea first, but I was pledged
to leave his income and his habits alone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Figgins came in while we were
having tea. We explained what I had come
about. She said it was a thing that ought
to be done more, that she was right down
glad I had spoke straight to Figgins, and she
hoped now that he would begin and make a
change for the better.</p>

<p>“But, my dear,” she said, “what we want
here is a mothers’ meeting. It is all very
well to tell one lot of mothers not to give a
new-born baby stewed rhubarb, but it is
equally necessary to tell mothers like Mrs.
Van Dieman not to give their infants raw
theory. I have to hold the next meeting of the
Parents’ Guild in my house. Will you come
and do a little district-visiting there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>I promised her that although James
would not wish me to initiate any form
of outrage, I would back her up in any she
liked to commit. The meeting was held
during the next week. I arrived early, and
we awaited events together. Presently the
door-bell rang. We peeped vulgarly through
the window. There was a terrible thing
upon the door-step—all face, like my enemy
the fish before it is filleted—it had the same
lifeless eye, and a flat hat balanced on the top
like a sheet of note-paper. It was looking
round in a dreadful vacant manner waiting
for admission. I remembered a story heard
in my infancy about some children who had
a stepmother with a glass eye and a wooden
tail. We were told how their flesh used
to creep with horror when they heard her
coming upstairs. In another minute she
would be in the room. We darted to our
places and listened with beating hearts to
the pat-pat on the stairs.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Flockson,” said the maid.</p>

<p>“Quite a large membership now, have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
we not?” said Mrs. Flockson, sitting down
in an attitude of faded gloom that infected
us both like a disease. I began to be
conscious of my back, and my legs, and
petticoats and things that I was usually
unaware of. “I shall be so interested to
hear what Miss Jamieson has to say about
children’s toys. It is so important, is it
not?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” said Mrs. Figgins
crisply. “I don’t think it is at all important,
but they would have it. I had much rather
they had spoken about children’s manners;
they are dreadful in this neighbourhood.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course, some are very bad,”
sighed Mrs. Flockson, “but it is so difficult,
isn’t it, to know just where to draw the line
without being too severe. They say now
it is so important that the character should
be developed along its natural lines. It
is so difficult not to impose one’s own individuality
too much, and yet to preserve
the idea of everything that is sweet and
gracious.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>Now, if I had been alone I could have
managed her perfectly. I could have kept
Mrs. Flockson happy without doing her an
atom of harm, but Mrs. Figgins is so abrupt.</p>

<p>“I can’t stop to think about individuality
when a child is gobbling and talking nonsense
at the same time,” she said. “I tell it at once,
‘Don’t eat like a pig,’ and then it doesn’t.
I don’t care whether I am imposing my individuality
or that of any other self-respecting
person who wishes to eat with Christians.”</p>

<p>Several more people came in then. They
were mostly badly dressed, and evidently put
all their money on expression so far as charm
was concerned; but then when people are
very much in earnest about things that are
of no consequence, and have as much consciousness
as rabbits, and are not very healthy,
it is difficult to make them look nice.</p>

<p>Miss Jamieson, a capable pink lady in a
well-made dress with irrelevant trimming,
spoke for half an hour on the question of
children’s toys. She told us what toys ought
to mean, and the qualities they ought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
foster in the child. How, if his taste were
trained in this manner, he would more
easily distinguish the good from the bad
later on. I asked whether a good taste in
dolls acquired in the nursery would help my
son not to fall in love with the wrong kind
of minx. I did not put it in just those
words, but Miss Jamieson did not give me
much comfort. She smiled kindly, and said
my question hardly came within the scope
of her paper, but she was sure a taste in dolls
would help very much, only boys did not
play much with dolls, did they?</p>

<p>Then some one got up and said there was
just one question she would like to ask, and
that was, when Miss Jamieson recommended
us to get those beautifully modelled animals
for the nursery—she would ask presently for
the address where they could be got—was
there any one particular animal more than
another that she recommended? And was
it better to begin with the tame animals, as
being less alarming, and work gradually up
to the jungle animals, or would that be giving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
the child a wrong idea of evolution, as, of
course, the wild animals did come first, didn’t
they?</p>

<p>Miss Jamieson disposed of this lady by
saying that, so long as they were animals of
noble instinct, she did not think it mattered
in what order they came, but she thought
that unpleasant animals, such as the glutton
or the sloth, should be kept for more advanced
study.</p>

<p>Other inquiries, such as whether a Noah’s
Ark were bad in case it biased the mind
towards the dogmatic side of religion, instead
of dwelling on the larger and more comprehensive
issues, and whether playing at
soldiers ever resulted in the child becoming
brutalised, were dealt with in their turn,
and then a vote of thanks to Miss Jamieson
was proposed, seconded, and carried, and we
had tea.</p>

<p>On the way home I passed a house where
a young friend of mine lives with his
barbarous parents. I felt it my duty to ask
how his father was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>“We ain’t seen ’im for three days,” said
Jimmy. “He’s been on the drunk and pawned
everything in the ’ouse—’e’s a fat-’ead, ’e is.”</p>

<p>I thought, as I walked home, that Mrs.
Flockson perhaps exaggerated the difficulty
that parents may have in preserving all that
is sweet and gracious without imposing their
own individuality too much upon their
children.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII_FOREIGN"><i>CHAPTER XXIII</i>: FOREIGN
TRAVEL</h2>
</div>


<p>A superfluity of efficient
females and inefficient Mrs. Muffs,
combined with the slow poison of
County Society, may disagree with anyone
in time. I explained this to our country
doctor, who is of a different variety to Dr.
Smithson. He wants everything boiled, and
is a great believer in the emotions.</p>

<p>Anyhow, we went abroad just to be out
of the way of the fish, and the best people,
and all the other things that annoyed me.</p>

<p>Packing up was a nightmare. I used to
let Louise pack for me, but then I arrived
at the end of my journey with a complete
outfit of clothes none of which I wanted;
besides such trifling mistakes as three combs—just
because they happened to be on the
dressing-table—and no Aspirin nor water-softener.</p>

<p>No one can pack for another without asking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
questions; neither can those who have
not Mrs. Simpson’s strong head remember
what they want to take so long as they are
being asked. When I was thinking whether
I could get my gloves cleaned by sending
them in at once, and whether I had better
take them myself or let Pierce leave them
with a message when he called for the fish,
Louise would say: “You will take your grey
whipcord coat, I suppose.”</p>

<p>I said “No,” because it is inevitable to
say “No” when anyone supposes we shall
do so-and-so. Of course, when I arrived I
wanted the coat, and could not remember
having said anything about it.</p>

<p>How does Mrs. Simpson meet such a
question as “How many evening dresses will
you take?” Especially as they always ask
just at the moment when one’s whole soul is
with a missing pair of silk stockings. I
undertook to pack for myself with even
more disastrous results.</p>

<p>I could think of nothing I wanted to take
until the last moment. I said to myself:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
“Dresses?—I must put them in last. Underclothes?—they
will not be back from the
wash until to-morrow. Shoes?—yes, they
go in first.” I wedged my dressing-table pots
and pans between my shoes and boots and
then I remembered that I should want to
wash next morning, so I took the pots and
pans out again and wandered round the room
looking for more things to pack. I collected
note-paper and books, stamps and a pen-knife,
and put them on a remote table while I went
to write a note about stopping the newspaper.
While I was doing this, Ruth asked me to
come and look at something, and, by the
time that was done, I felt I had broken the
back of the packing business. There were
only the clean clothes from the laundry to
put in; and my dresses; there did not seem
to be anything else.</p>

<p>How different from the morning of
departure! Then every table in every room
swarmed with things which had to go, and
my box was already full of boots! By the
time all the fat three-cornered things had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
gone in, the box shut comfortably; but there
were no dresses in it and no underclothes.</p>

<p>I asked James very gently whether he
could take a few small things. “Oh, easily,”
he said, “anything you like.” (He now adds
“within reason,” when he undertakes to help
me.)</p>

<p>So I took him just a few small things, such
as my writing-case. He said it had an utterly
unmanageable figure, but that was because I
was taking a lot of unanswered letters to do
while we were away. That was all except
a tin of biscuits, a bottle of bath salts—I had
to get a good-sized one, as we were to be
away for some time—a case of tools and my
work-basket. Really nothing to what I had
managed to fit into my own box; besides, I
offered to take some of his shirts in exchange.</p>

<p>The carriage was at the door when I ran
upstairs to get a pin for my veil, and there,
on the dressing-table, I found all the writing
things I had collected two days before, my
hair-pins, brush and comb, and powder-box.
James said they could not all go in his pocket,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
so I carried them under my arm, intending
to repack my dressing-case in the train.</p>

<p>James’s account of our journey contains
much that is unfair and exaggerated. He
says, for instance, that during the long
night journey from Calais to Rome I showed
want of consideration for the comfort of
our fellow-passengers. The train was very
crowded; we could not have a sleeping
compartment to ourselves, so it was arranged
that Louise and I and a strange lady should
be huddled together in one dog’s-hole of a
place, and James would join a man’s party in
the next.</p>

<p>The lady who dangled a pair of fat, booted
ankles above my head possessed an over-anxious
husband; therefore, I suppose, she
had a surname, but I never discovered it. To
me she was, and always will be, “Georgie.”
We had settled down for the night in considerable
irritability, and the atmosphere of
hell, when the door was pushed gently open.</p>

<p>“Georgie, my dear, are you all right?”
inquired a timid little voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<p>Georgie, who was determined to enjoy
everything and look on the bright side, said,
“Yes, thank you, dear,” in a crisp voice, and
composed herself to sleep. Presently there
was a knock at the door.</p>

<p>“Georgie, my dear, would you care for a
little chocolate?”</p>

<p>Dear, good-natured Georgie had already
begun to sleep; I heard her quite distinctly.
But she awoke—out of that first blissful
state, just imagine! and with all the discomfort
of sleeping in her stockings and
everything—and gratefully accepted the
chocolate.</p>

<p>Next time there was a knock I nearly
choked myself in efforts for politeness. I
longed to say, “Go away. I will give
Georgie a pocket-handkerchief, and the nut-crackers,
and some Balsam of Peru when she
wakes.” Fortunately, Georgie was breathing
so loudly that even he understood that for
the moment all the husbands in Christendom
could not improve her condition, and, therefore,
retired for some hours. The crisis was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
next morning. Anyone who has travelled
knows how easy it is to mislay anything,
however large, in a sleeping berth. If you
put a hippopotamus under your pillow at
night, it will be gone in the morning. My
hair-pins, side-combs, hat, waistband, and
shoes were all rescued from different parts
of the train by Louise, but my jewellery I
was determined not to part with. I put my
watch, rings, and ear-rings into my purse,
and put the purse into a travelling-case which
I strapped to the rack by my side. It was
there in the morning when I awoke, and
remained there while I dressed. I then
unfastened the strap, and laid the case on the
bed for a moment, while I pinned my hat. I
looked round and it was gone. I threw the
bedclothes into the passage and shook them;
I took off the mattress and turned it; Louise
and I took her bed to pieces and threw it
also into the passage. My condition was
desperate. In a quarter of an hour we should
be at the end of our journey, and the train
would disappear into an everlasting nowhere,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
carrying the beloved companions of my life
embedded in its ugly, screaming, joggling
anatomy. Some shameless, painted, French
official’s wife would eventually wear my
darlings on her fingers, and dangling from
her ears. I could never get any more,
because they were James’s wedding presents.
Life and happiness were blotted from my
imagination.</p>

<p>“Georgie, my dear,” said the little
voice at that moment, “can you come
down?”</p>

<p>A small step-ladder scraped gently across
my shins. “Pardon me, one moment,” I was
requested, and there was Georgie’s plump
little kid leg dangling in front of my nose
once more. That was the crisis!</p>

<p>“Oh, damn Georgie,” I cried. “Go
away, I’ve lost my bag.”</p>

<p>The little kid leg drew up hurriedly into
its place, and dear, kind, shocked Georgie
peered down upon me from above. Her
over-anxious husband had fled, and was, I
suppose, sipping a little cold water in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
lavatory in order to pull himself together
after “such an exhibition.”</p>

<p>“If I stay in this beastly train for a
thousand years and pick it to pieces myself
with a pair of nail-scissors, I will find that
thing,” I said.</p>

<p>“My dear, don’t upset yourself,” urged
Georgie. “Shall I not call your husband?”</p>

<p>The venturesome little boot was longing
to get down, for the train was nearly at its
destination, but, in my agitation, I forgot
that I had overturned its only means of
escape.</p>

<p>When James came in and picked up the
bag from behind the hold-all, I felt inclined
to take Georgie in my arms and lift her
down, but there was so little room in the
compartment that I decided to smile at her
instead, and say I “had found my bag, thank
you,” leaving her where she was. I tactfully
withdrew to the corridor and made no sign,
even when I heard the pattering feet and
consolatory “Georgie, my dear,” close behind
the door of our den.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>James has a passion for sight-seeing, which
I do not share. As soon as I know that
there is anything to be seen I no longer want
to see it. To have an alert, smiling man
come up and say, “You want spik English;
you come with me,” gives me another sort
of Mrs. Simpson. She is a lively, early-breakfast
Mrs. Simpson, full of exclamation
points. She replies at once: “Ach! you spik
English! that is capital! Rosbif! Goddam!
I come vis you,” and off they go in ecstasies.</p>

<p>An English guide who takes one over a
ruin has a certain dreary charm. One can
go to sleep and dream happily while he grinds
away: “This portion of the Castle was erected
in 1647. Notice the remains of moat and
transept with traces of fine oriel window in
memory of the seventh Lord. During the
encounter with the rebellious forces Oliver
Cromwell took possession of the east wing,
when the enemy was repulsed with great
loss. The marks on the bastion show
remains of staircase leading to the old ’all
which was reserved for the use of the ladies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
of the family during time of siege. In the
museum will be seen famous portrait of wife
of the tenth Earl, destroyed by fire in the
year 1754—come along there, please, and
mind your heads.”</p>

<p>But, in Rome, if you escape from one
voluble tormentor you fall into the hands of
a dozen worse, and there are the reverent,
industrious sight-seers with red books, mixed
up among the irreverent ones with walking-sticks.</p>

<p>“On the right hand, and a little to the
left, are the famous baths of Caracalla,” may
be heard from behind one pillar. “Note
the exquisite workmanship of the masonry,
and the height of the columns leading to
the Peplon or outer court of the Vestal
Virgins.”</p>

<p>From the other side of the same pillar
comes a voice like a saw cutting through
wood.</p>

<p>“Here, you, Sparghetti, Antonio, what’s
your name? Was there any charge, can you
tell me, for mixed bathing in those days?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
Bagno melange, Caracalla’s time, how much,
eh?”</p>

<p>James understands pictures, and enjoys
them. I tested my own taste in these matters,
but did not force the experiment in any way.
As soon as I became quite certain that I did
not like pictures, I waited for him outside,
dabbling my fingers in the water (it was in
Venice that I definitely made up my mind),
and enjoying the smells. Perhaps it was
indigestion from eating too much Italian food,
but the Tintorettos got on my nerves from
their invariable suggestion of vermicelli.
There were acres of canvas representing nude
figures falling in hundreds from great heights.
Some of them may have been climbing up,
but the places were so dark that it was not
easy to see the difference; anyhow, vermicelli
being thrown into the air or vermicelli falling
into a pan look pretty much alike. So
I stayed outside and forgot all about the Day
of Judgment.</p>

<p>The longer I live, the more I believe in
Adam and Eve. Good gains nothing by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
comparison with evil. There is no pleasure
like ignorance in fine weather, and the most
illuminating conversation is no gain to those
who are able to “go into a field and make a
noise like a turnip.”</p>

<p>I know few people with whom I can go
abroad without bringing on an attack of Mrs.
Simpson. From the guides with their “You
want spik English, you come with me,” and
the waiters who seek favour with promises
of “Rosbif” or “Nice hammonekks,” to
our kind foreign friends who ask us whether
we are not missing the fog and would we
like brandy in our tea?—it is evident that
Mrs. Simpson has set her mark upon every
continent. Mrs. Simpson abroad is different
from the furniture-remover’s goddess. She
is timid to the verge of idiocy, and bold
where reticence would be more graceful;
she is always unmarried, except in such cases
where she has a male creature attached to
her by such a tie as unites a pair of frogs.
She is fabulously rich, and so devoid of discrimination
in what she buys that it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
be ill-bred in shopkeepers to practise deception
on her were it not that she does not
believe in God; and, therefore, it is right
that good persons should have her money
before she is removed to hell.</p>

<p>People of other countries, who have lived
or stayed in England or have made English
friends abroad, know nothing of this Mrs.
Simpson; she is a product of the foreign
railways and hotels, like the American whom
we all know by sight and hearsay but who
is unrecognised by his own countrymen.
All the same, it was a long time before I
could enjoy myself anywhere out of England
without feeling the spell cast upon my spirit
by the dreary, woebegone, helpless mothers
and daughters, husbands and wives, who
wandered away to their bedrooms in single
file between meals, were always blocking up
the bureau, asking questions about baths and
the English services, and who stared at one
another in the lifts, and talked in undertones
at their little tables. There was one couple,
in an hotel in Rome, who made conversation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
to each other for a week on what I judged
from their faces to be such subjects as mausoleums,
dentists, cold cream, and muffins.
At last the husband said something really
amusing—I heard it with great pleasure—to
which his wife made a grimace and said:
“Really, dear, you are quite beyond me
altogether.”</p>

<p>Henry—I remember that was his name—ought
not to have stood it, but he did. He
ought to have slapped her, and kicked over
the table and left the room for ever. I
should have rejoiced, more than I can say, on
account of the blow that it would have given,
in every town in Baedeker, to the continental
Mrs. Simpson.</p>

<p>I paid dearly for my rashness in leaving
the shores of England. When I returned
the sword had fallen.</p>

<p>Mullins had been saving steadily during
the past years, and Ruth had undertaken to
marry him in the spring. Much as she disliked
being interfered with, she disliked still
more being left to herself; but whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
marriage forms any solution to this dilemma,
it will be for her to decide. I shall encourage
the young Mullinses if there are any, remembering
always that a wife and mother
cannot give notice.</p>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
